Fasta Åland is separated from the coast of Sweden by forty  kilometres (twenty-five  miles) of open water to the west. In the east, the Åland archipelago is virtually contiguous with the Finnish  Archipelago Sea.

Éire is still used in the Irish language today to refer to the island of Ireland as well as the Republic of Ireland - as well as the goddess. The  dative form Éirinn is anglicized as Erin, which is occasionally used as a poetic name for Ireland in English, and has also become a common feminine name in English.The name was given in Article 4 of the 1937  Irish constitution to the Irish state, created under the 1921  Anglo-Irish Treaty, which was known between 1922 and 1937 as the  Irish Free State. Article 4 stated that: \"The name of the state is Éire, or, in the English language, Ireland.\"The name \"Éire\" features on all  Irish coinage (and  Irish euro coins), postage stamps, passports and other official state documents issued since 1937 — for instance the  Official Seal of the President of Ireland. Before then, \"Saorstát Éireann\", the Irish translation of  Irish Free State, was used except for postage stamps which regularly used \"Éire\" during the Irish Free State era in both definitive and special issues.Since 1949, the term Republic of Ireland has generally been used in preference to Éire, when speaking English. It is sometimes felt that use of \"Éire\" is associated with a condescending attitude to Ireland in some right-wing quarters of the  British media. Technically, as the  Republic of Ireland Act enacted in 1948 makes clear, the \"Republic of Ireland\" is actually a description rather than the name of the state, even if generally used as such.',\n",

During his reign, the neighbouring kingdom of Dál Riata was subjugated and the  kingdom of Strathclyde was attacked with less success. The most powerful ruler in Scotland for over two decades, he was involved in wars in Ireland and England.

Some historians consider the era from about  1914 to  1992 to be the  Short Twentieth Century.The twentieth century was a period of radical departure in the way almost every previous area of human activity. Accelerating scientific understanding, better communications, faster transportation transformed the world in those hundred years more than any time in the past. It was a century that started with steam powered ships as the most sophisticated means of transport, and ended with the  space shuttle. Horses, and other pack animals, Western humanity's basic form of personal transportation for thousands of years were replaced by  automobiles within the span of a few decades.The twentieth century saw a remarkable shift in the way that vast numbers of people lived, as a result of technological, medical, social, ideological, and political innovation. Arguably more technological advances occurred in any 10 year period following World War I than the sum total of new technological development in any previous century. Terms like  ideology,  world war,  genocide, and  nuclear war entered common usage and became an influence on the lives of everyday people. War reached an unprecedented scale and level of sophistication; in the Second World War (1939-1945) alone, approximately  57 million people died, mainly due to massive improvements in weaponry. The trends of mechanization of goods and services and networks of global communication, which were begun in the 19th century, continued at an ever-increasing pace in the 20th. In spite of the terror and chaos, the 20th century saw many attempts at world peace. Virtually every aspect of life in virtually every human society changed in some fundamental way or another during the twentieth century and for the first time, any individual could influence the course of history no matter their background.

The experiment is expected to measure phenomena that involve highly massive  particles which were not measurable using earlier lower-energy accelerators and might shed light on new  theories of  particle physics beyond the  Standard Model.The ATLAS collaboration, the group of  physicists building the detector, was formed in 1992 when the proposed EAGLE (Experiment for Accurate Gamma, Lepton and Energy Measurements) and ASCOT (Apparatus with Super COnducting Toroids) collaborations merged their efforts into building a single, general-purpose particle detector for the Large Hadron Collider. The design was a combination of those two previous designs, as well as the detector research and development that had been done for the  Superconducting Supercollider. The ATLAS experiment was proposed in its current form in 1994, and officially funded by the CERN member countries beginning in 1995. Additional countries,  universities, and  laboratories joined in subsequent years, and further institutions and physicists continue to join the collaboration even today. The work of construction began at individual institutions, with detector components shipped to CERN and assembled in the ATLAS experimental pit beginning in 2003.ATLAS is designed as a general-purpose detector. When the proton  beams produced by the Large Hadron Collider interact in the centre of the detector, a variety of different particles with a broad range of energies may be produced. Rather than focusing on a particular physical process, ATLAS is designed to measure the broadest possible range of signals. This is intended to ensure that, whatever form any new physical processes or particles might take, ATLAS will be able to detect them and measure their properties. Experiments at earlier colliders, such as the  Tevatron and  Large Electron-Positron Collider, were designed based on a similar philosophy.

       " 'Aberration_of_light': 'The aberration of light (also referred to as astronomical aberration or stellar aberration) is an astronomical phenomenon which produces an  apparent motion of celestial objects. It was discovered and later explained by the third  Astronomer Royal,  James Bradley, in  1725, who attributed it to the finite speed of light and the motion of Earth in its orbit around the Sun.At the instant of any observation of an object, the apparent position of the object is displaced from its true position by an amount which depends upon the transverse component of the  velocity of the observer, with respect to the vector of the incoming beam of light (i.e., the line actually taken by the light on its path to the observer). In the case of an observer on Earth, the direction of its velocity varies during the year as Earth  revolves around the Sun (or strictly speaking, the  barycenter of the solar system), and this in turn causes the apparent position of the object to vary. This particular effect is known as annual aberration or stellar aberration, because it causes the apparent position of a star to vary periodically over the course of a year. The maximum amount of the aberrational displacement of a star is approximately 20  arcseconds in  right ascension or  declination. Although this is a relatively small value, it was well within the observational capability of the instruments available in the early eighteenth century.Aberration should not be confused with  stellar parallax, although it was an initially fruitless search for parallax that first led to its discovery. Parallax is caused by a change in the position of the observer looking at a relatively nearby object, as measured against more distant objects, and is therefore dependent upon the distance between the observer and the object.In contrast, stellar aberration is independent of the distance of a celestial object from the observer, and depends only on the observer\\'s instantaneous transverse velocity with respect to the incoming light beam, at the moment of observation. The light beam from a distant object cannot itself have any transverse velocity component, or it could not (by definition) be seen by the observer, since it would miss the observer. Thus, any transverse velocity of the emitting source plays no part in aberration. Another way to state this is that the emitting object may have a transverse velocity with respect to the observer, but any light beam emitted from it which reaches the observer, cannot, for it must have been previously emitted in such a direction that its transverse component has been \"corrected\" for. Such a beam must come \"straight\" to the observer along a line which connects the observer with the position of the object when it emitted the light.Aberration should also be distinguished from  light-time correction, which is due to the motion of the observed object, like a planet, through space during the time taken by its light to reach an observer on Earth. Light-time correction depends upon the velocity and distance of the emitting object during the time it takes for its light to travel to Earth. Light-time correction does not depend on the motion of the Earth—it only depends on Earth\\'s position at the instant when the light is observed. Aberration is usually larger than a planet\\'s light-time correction except when the planet is near  quadrature (90° from the Sun), where aberration drops to zero because then the Earth is directly approaching or receding from the planet. At  opposition to or  conjunction with the Sun, aberration is 20.5\" while light-time correction varies from 4\" for Mercury to 0.37\" for Neptune (the Sun\\'s light-time correction is less than 0.03\").',\n",

       " 'Abraham_Lincoln': \"Abraham Lincoln ( February 12,  1809 –  April 15,  1865) was an  American politician who was elected the 16th President of the United States (serving from 1861 to 1865), and was the first president from the  Republican Party. Today, he is best known for ending  slavery and preserving the  Union through his supervision of the Federal (i.e., Northern) forces during the American Civil War. He selected the generals and approved their strategy; selected senior civilian officials; supervised diplomacy, patronage, and party operations; and rallied public opinion through messages and speeches. Lincoln's influence was magnified by his powerful rhetoric; his Gettysburg Address rededicated the nation to freedom and democracy and remains a core component of the American value system.To achieve his main goal of preserving the Union, Lincoln first ended slavery in the  Confederacy through his  Emancipation Proclamation (1863), then in 1865 secured passage of the  Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to abolish slavery forever. He took personal charge of  Reconstruction, seeking to speedily re-unite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. He was opposed by the  Radical Republicans, who advocated much harsher policies.His leadership qualities were evident in his bringing all factions of the party into his cabinet, in defusing a war scare with Britain in 1861, in handling the border slave states in 1861, and in his landslide reelection in  1864 presidential election.  Copperheads criticized him vehemently for refusing to compromise on slavery, declaring  martial law, suspending the writ of  habeas corpus, ordering arrests of 18,000 opponents including public officials and newspaper publishers, needlessly ending the lives of hundreds of thousands of young soldiers in the war, and for overstepping the bounds of executive power as set forth in the Constitution. On the other hand, Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery, and not being ruthless enough toward the conquered South.Lincoln had a lasting influence on U.S. political and social institutions, redefining  republican values, promoting nationalism, and enlarging the powers of the federal government.  Scholars rank Lincoln as one of the two or three greatest presidents. His assassination in 1865 as the war ended made him a martyr for national unity and an icon of Americanism.\",\n",
       " 'Absinthe': \"Absinthe (also absinth) ( IPA English: [ˈæbsɪnθ]  IPA French: [ap.sɛ̃t]) is a  distilled, highly alcoholic,  anise- flavored spirit derived from  herbs including the flowers and leaves of the medicinal plant  Artemisia absinthium, also called  wormwood. Although it is sometimes incorrectly called a  liqueur, absinthe is not bottled with added sugar and is therefore classified as a liquor or spirit.Absinthe is often referred to as la Fée Verte ('The Green  Fairy') because of its coloring — typically pale or  emerald green, but sometimes clear or in rare cases rose red. Due to its high  proof and concentration of  oils, absintheurs (absinthe drinkers) typically add three to five parts ice-cold water to a dose of absinthe, which causes the drink to turn cloudy (called 'louching'); often the water is used to dissolve added sugar to decrease bitterness. This preparation is considered an important part of the experience of drinking absinthe, so much so that it has become ritualized, complete with special slotted  absinthe spoons and other accoutrements. Absinthe's flavor is similar to anise-flavored liqueurs, with a light bitterness and greater complexity imparted by multiple herbs.Modern absinthe originated in Switzerland as an  elixir but is better known for its popularity in late 19th and early 20th century France, particularly among Parisian artists and writers whose romantic associations with the drink still linger in popular culture. In its heyday, the most popular brand of absinthe worldwide was  Pernod Fils. At the height of this popularity, absinthe was portrayed as a dangerously  addictive,  psychoactive drug; the chemical  thujone was blamed for most of its deleterious effects. By 1915, it was banned in a number of European countries and the United States. Even though it was vilified, no evidence shows it to be any more dangerous than ordinary alcohol. A modern absinthe revival began in the 1990s, as countries in the European Union began to reauthorize its manufacture and sale.\",\n",

The Absolute zero temperature is known to be 0 K (-273.15 C). While it is possible to cool any substance to near Absolute Zero, it can never actually be achieved.Absolute zero is the point at which particles have a minimum energy, determined by quantum mechanical effects, which is called the  zero-point energy.By international agreement, absolute zero is defined as precisely 0 K on the  Kelvin scale, which is a thermodynamic (absolute) temperature scale, and -273.15°C on the  Celsius scale. Absolute zero is also precisely equivalent to 0 °R on the  Rankine scale (also a thermodynamic temperature scale), and –459.67 °F on the  Fahrenheit scale.Whilst scientists cannot fully achieve a state of “zero” heat energy in a substance, they have made great advancements in achieving temperatures ever closer to absolute zero (where matter exhibits odd  quantum effects).

       " 'Accountancy': \"Accountancy ( profession) or accounting ( methodology) is the measurement, disclosure or provision of assurance about financial information that helps managers, investors, tax authorities and other decision makers make resource allocation decisions.  Financial accounting is one branch of accounting and historically has involved processes by which financial information about a business is recorded, classified, summarized, interpreted, and communicated. Auditing, a related but separate discipline, has two sub-disciplines: Internal and External auditing. External auditing is the process whereby an independent auditor examines an organization's financial statements and accounting records in order to express an opinion — that conveys reasonable but not absolute assurance — as to the truth and fairness of the statements and the accountant's adherence to  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), in all material respects.Internal auditing is an examination in which management, and not the external public, is the main beneficiary. It is carried out usually by auditors employed by the company, but sometimes by external service providers. The internal auditor's role is broader, and basically depends on what kind of assurance management wants. It usually certifies the efficiency and effectiveness of processes, departments, projects or internal controls. The Institute of Internal Auditors is generally accepted as the custodian of Internal Auditing best practice.At the heart of accounting is the measurement of financial transactions which are transfers of legal property rights made under contractual relationships. Non-financial transactions are specifically excluded due to conservatism and materiality principles.Practitioners of accountancy are known as  accountants. There are many professional bodies for accountants throughout the world. Many allow their members to use titles indicating their membership. Examples are  Chartered Certified Accountant ( ACCA or  FCCA),  Chartered Accountant (FCA, CA or ACA) and  Certified Public Accountant (CPA).Accountancy attempts to create accurate  financial reports that are useful to managers, regulators, and other  stakeholders such as  shareholders,  creditors, or owners. The day-to-day record-keeping involved in this process is known as  bookkeeping.At the heart of modern financial accounting is the  double-entry bookkeeping system. This system involves making at least two entries for every transaction: a debit in one account, and a corresponding credit in another account. The sum of all debits should always equal the sum of all credits. This provides an easy way to check for errors. This system was first used in medieval Europe, although claims have been made that the system dates back to Ancient Greece.According to critics of  standard accounting practices, it has changed little since.  Accounting reform measures of some kind have been taken in each generation to attempt to keep  bookkeeping relevant to capital assets or production capacity. However, these have not changed the basic principles, which are supposed to be independent of economics as such. In recent times, the divergence of accounting from economic principles has resulted in controversial reforms to make financial reports more indicative of economic reality.\",\n",

The droplets then fall to earth as rain, snow,  mist, dry  dust,  hail, or  sleet. This increases the acidity of the soil, and affects the chemical balance of lakes and streams.The term \"acid rain\" is sometimes used more generally to include all forms of  acid deposition — both  wet deposition, where acidic gases and particles are removed by rain or other  precipitation, and dry deposition removal of gases and particles to the Earth\\'s surface in the absence of precipitation.Acid rain is defined as any type of  precipitation with a  pH that is unusually low. Dissolved carbon dioxide dissociates to form weak  carbonic acid giving a pH of approximately 5.6 at typical atmospheric concentrations of CO2. Therefore a pH of less than 5.6 has sometimes been used as a definition of acid rain. However, natural sources of acidity mean that in remote areas, rain has a pH which is between 4.5 and 5.6 with an average value of 5.0 and so rain with a pH of less than 5 is a more appropriate definition. The US EPA says, \"Acid rain is a serious environmental problem that affects large parts of the US and Canada\"  Acid rain accelerates  weathering in  carbonate rocks and accelerates  building weathering.

Inspired by  William Penn, Light's design set out Adelaide in a grid layout, interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by  parkland. Early Adelaide was shaped by religious freedom and a commitment to political  progressivism and civil liberties, which led to world-first reforms. Adelaidean society remained largely  puritan up until the 1970s, when a set of social reforms under the  premiership of  Don Dunstan resulted in a cultural revival. Today Adelaide is known for its many  festivals as well as for its wine, arts and sports.As South Australia's seat of government and commercial centre, Adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions. Most of these are concentrated in the city centre along the cultural boulevard of  North Terrace and in various districts of the metropolitan area.\",\n",

Among the themes and issues explored in African American literature are the role of African Americans within the larger American society, African American culture,  racism, slavery, and  equality.As African Americans' place in American society has changed over the centuries, so, too, have the foci of African American literature. Before the American Civil War, African American literature primarily focused on the issue of slavery, as indicated by the popular subgenre of  slave narratives. At the turn of the 20th century, books by authors such as  W.E.B. DuBois and  Booker T. Washington debated whether to confront or appease racist attitudes in the United States. During the  American Civil Rights movement, authors like  Richard Wright and  Gwendolyn Brooks wrote about issues of  racial segregation and  black nationalism.

The brush-tailed porcupine is one of the biggest  rodents in Africa, growing almost three feet long and weigh as much as eight pounds. It has an elongated rat-like face and body and short legs, tipped with clawed and webbed feet. Unlike most other porcupines, the brush-tailed porcupine has lighter and smaller quills. On the tail, these quills are thinner and brush-like. These can make noise when rattled. Brush-tailed porcupines live in small family groups of about eight members. Different family groups can share resources. When attacked by a  predator, the porcupine raises its quills so it looks twice its size, rattles its tail quills, and stomps its feet. As with all porcupines, the brush-tailed porcupine would back into the attacker and inflict damage with its quills.The brush-tailed porcupine is mostly herbivorous. When alone eating, the porcupines can be quite nervous. During the breeding season, males and females form pair bonds (just like how people go on dates) to get acquainted.

Two colonies were established by penguins in the 1980s on the mainland near Cape Town at  Boulders Beach near  Simon's Town and Stony Point in  Betty's Bay. Mainland colonies probably only became possible in recent times due the reduction of predator numbers, although the Betty's Bay colony has been attacked by leopards. The only other mainland colony is in Namibia, but it is not known when this was established.Boulders Beach is a popular tourist attraction, for the beach, swimming and the penguins. The penguins will allow people to approach them as close as a meter (three feet), and so are much photographed.The closest relatives of the African Penguins are the  Humboldt and Magellanic penguins found in southern South America and the  Galápagos Penguin found in the Pacific Ocean near the  equator. African Penguins like warm weather.African Penguins grow to 68-70 cm (26.7-27.5 in) tall and weigh between 2 and 4 kilograms. They have a black stripe and black spots on the chest, the spots being unique for every penguin, like human fingerprints. They have pink  sweat glands above their eyes. The hotter the penguin gets, the more blood is sent to these sweat glands so it may be cooled by the surrounding air, thus making the glands more pink. The males are larger than the females and have larger beaks, but their beaks are pointer than those of the Humboldt.They breed throughout the year, the main breeding season starting in February. Females lay two eggs, with an  incubation period of 38-42 days. They are a  monogamous species and the lifelong partners take turns to  incubate their eggs and feed their young. The  moulting season is between October and February, with the majority of the birds moulting in November and December, after which they head out to sea to feed (since they do not feed during moulting season and remain on land). Their diet includes small fish such as  sardines and  anchovies. The penguins obtain water from the fish they eat.African Penguins have an average lifespan of 10-11 years, the females reaching sexual maturity at the age of 4 years, and males at the age of 5 years. The highest recorded age for a bird of this species has been 24, however several individual birds have lived to be up to 40 years old in aquarium settings. The current population (as of 2003) estimated at 179,000 adults, with 56,000 breeding pairs.As recently as the mid-twentieth century, penguin eggs were considered a delicacy and were still being collected for sale. Unfortunately, the practice was to smash any eggs found a few days prior to gathering, in order to ensure that only fresh ones were sold. This added to the drastic decline of the penguin population around the Cape coast, a decline which was hastened by the removal of  guano from islands for use as fertilizer, eliminating the burrowing material used by penguins. Penguins remain susceptible to pollution of their habitat by  petrochemicals from spills, shipwrecks and cleaning of tankers while at sea.Disaster struck on June 23, 2000, when the iron ore tanker MV Treasure sank between Robben Island and Dassen Island, oiling 19,000 adult penguins at the height of the best breeding season on record for this vulnerable species. The oiled birds were brought to an abandoned train repair warehouse in Cape Town to be cared for. An additional 19,500 un-oiled penguins were removed from Dassen Island before the oil slick reached their island, and were released 800 miles up the West coast. This gave workers enough time to clean up the oiled waters and shores before the birds could complete their long swim home. Tens of thousands of volunteers descended upon Cape Town to help with the rescue and rehabilitation process, which was overseen by IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare) and the  South African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (SANCCOB), and took more than three months to complete. Although this was the largest animal rescue event in history, more than 91% of the penguins were successfully rehabilitated and released - an amazing feat that could not have been accomplished without such a tremendous international response.The African Penguin is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds ( AEWA) applies.\",\n",

It is the primary language used by two related ethnic groups: the  Afrikaners and the  Coloureds or kleurlinge/bruinmense (including  Basters,  Cape Malays and  Griqua). These two groups are collectively known as Afrikaanses, roughly meaning \"the language community of Afrikaans-speakers\". It is also spoken as a first language by many  Tswana people in South Africa\\'s North West Province.Geographically, the Afrikaans language is the majority language of the western one-third of South Africa ( Northern and  Western Cape, spoken at home by 69% and 58%, respectively). It is also the largest first language in the adjacent southern one-third of Namibia ( Hardap and  Karas, where it is the first language of 43% and 41%, respectively). It is the most widely used second language throughout both of these countries for the population as a whole, although the younger generation has better proficiency in English.The name Afrikaans is simply the Dutch word for African, i.e. the African form of the Dutch language. The dialect became known as \" Cape Dutch\". Later, Afrikaans was sometimes also referred to as \"African Dutch\" or \"Kitchen Dutch\", although some now consider these terms  pejorative. Afrikaans was considered a Dutch  dialect until the late 19th century, when it began to be recognised as a distinct language, and it gained equal status with Dutch and English as an official language in South Africa in 1925. Dutch remained an official language until the new 1961 constitution finally stipulated the two official languages in South Africa to be Afrikaans and English (although, curiously, the 1961 constitution still had a sub-clause stipulating that the word \"Afrikaans\" was also meant to be referring to the Dutch language). The 1925 decision led Dutch to enter disuse and be replaced by Afrikaans for all purposes.There are basically three dialects, of which the  northeastern variant (which developed into a literary language in the  Transvaal) forms the basis of the  written standard. Within the Dutch-speaking zones of the Netherlands, Belgium and Suriname, there is greater divergence among the dialects than there is between standard Dutch and standard Afrikaans. Although Afrikaans knows some typical Hollandic tones, there particularly exist striking similarities between Afrikaans and  Zeeuws (the dialect of the  Zeeland province of the Netherlands which has also similarities with West Flemish). Zeeland is a coastal province of the Netherlands and most of the Dutch spoken in former Dutch colonies is very much influenced by Zeeuws/the Zeeland dialect as many people from Zeeland were involved in The Netherlands\\' emperial/colonial expansion.It was originally the dialect that developed among the  Afrikaner  Protestant  settlers and the indentured or slave workforce brought to the  Cape area in southwestern South Africa by the  Dutch East India Company (Dutch: Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie — VOC, Afrikaans: Nederlandse Oos-Indiese Kompanjie - NOIK) between  1652 and  1705.

Some agnostics take a stronger view that the concept of a deity is incoherent, thus meaningless and irrelevant to life. The term is used to describe those who are unconvinced or noncommittal about the existence of deities as well as about other matters of religion. Early Christian church leaders used the  Greek word  gnosis (knowledge) to describe \"spiritual knowledge\". \"Agnostic\" came from the union of it to the Greek / Latin prefix a, and was originally coined by  Thomas Henry Huxley in  1869 to describe his philosophy. Agnosticism is not to be confused with religious views opposing the doctrine of  gnosis and  Gnosticism— these are religious concepts that are not generally related to agnosticism.Agnostics claim that either it is not possible to have absolute or certain knowledge or, alternatively, that while certainty may be possible, they personally have no knowledge. Agnosticism in both cases involves some form of  skepticism. Data collection services often display the common use of the term, distinct from atheism in its lack of disputing the existence of deities.Agnostics are normally listed alongside categories such as  atheist and  non-religious, although this may be misleading.

Commercial flights are scheduled to begin in 2007 after lengthy delays. During much of its development phase, the aircraft was known as the Airbus A3XX. The  nickname Superjumbo has become associated with the A380.The A380's upper deck extends along the entire length of the fuselage. This allows for a spacious cabin with 50% more floor space than the next largest airliner, the  Boeing 747-400, providing seating for 555 people in standard  three-class configuration or up to 853 people in full  economy class configuration. Two models of the A380 are available. The A380-800, the passenger model, is the largest passenger airliner in the world, superseding the Boeing 747. The other launch model, the A380-800F, will be one of the largest  freight aircraft and will have a payload capacity exceeded only by the  Antonov An-225.The A380-800 has a maximum range of 15,000  kilometres (8,000  nmi, sufficient to fly from Chicago to Sydney nonstop), and a cruising speed of  Mach 0.85 (about 900 km/h or 560 MPH at cruise altitude), similar to that of the Boeing 747.\",\n",

       " 'Aircraft_carrier': 'An aircraft carrier is a  warship designed to deploy and recover aircraft — in effect acting as a sea-going  airbase. Aircraft carriers thus allow a  naval force to project  air power great distances without having to depend on local bases for land-based aircraft.Modern navies that operate such ships treat aircraft carriers as the  capital ship of the fleet, a role previously played by the  battleship. The change, part of the growth of air power as a significant part of warfare, took place during World War II. A battleship could fire hundreds of large caliber shells at a target and score possibly a dozen hits. Their maximum range was usually no more than thirty miles. However, an aircraft launched from a carrier could deliver \" smart weapons\" accurately at a range of over one hundred miles. Thus, the aircraft carrier could perform the original mission of the battleship, causing heavy damage to an enemy fleet at great distance and with superior accuracy. Due to the long range of the striking aircraft heavy armour was less of a requirement and because of this, for example during World War II, aircraft carriers were less expensive and time consuming to build than battleships. Unescorted carriers are considered vulnerable to attack by other ships, aircraft, submarines or missiles and therefore travel as part of a  carrier battle group. Unlike other types of capital ships in the 20th century, aircraft carrier designs since World War II have been effectively unlimited by any consideration save budgetary, and the ships have ballooned in size accordingly: The large, modern  Nimitz class of United States Navy carriers has a displacement nearly four times that of the World War II-era  USS Enterprise.',\n",

Their widest use took place from roughly  1900 through the  1930s. However, their use decreased over time as their capabilities were surpassed by those of airplanes.

With the  Turing test, he made a significant and characteristically provocative contribution to the debate regarding  artificial intelligence: whether it will ever be possible to say that a machine is  conscious and can  think. During World War II, Turing worked at  Bletchley Park, Britain\\'s  codebreaking centre, and was for a time head of  Hut 8, the section responsible for German Naval cryptanalysis.

Albrecht Rodenbach’s father was Julius Rodenbach (1824-1915) from the Rhineland, and his mother was Silvia de la Houttre (1834-1899). Although his mother was a  Walloon from  Doornik, she had adopted the Dutch spoken in Roeselare.Rodenbach attended the small catholic seminary in  Roeselare where he was exposed to the ideas of the  Flemish movement by  Hugo Verriest and others. Rodenbach was also influenced at this time by  Guido Gezelle. In the 1874-1875 school year, this led to a conflict between the Flemish students and the school’s francophile director. At the annual songfest the students traditionally sang French songs, Rodenbach led the protest and the predominately Dutch speaking students sang a protest song in Dutch. This protest led to similar protests all over Belgium. Despite this and other activist activities, Rodenbach graduated with a first in rhetoric in 1876.At the  University of Leuven he met the poet Pol de Mont who was a year older. Together they sought to promote a Flemish artistic revival and equal rights for Flemish students as a student movement, creating the “Algemene Vlaamse Studentenbond” (All Flemish Student Association) in 1876. Among their objectives were to have classes in Dutch and to have classes include Flemish culture. The association’s illustrated magazine Het Pennoen (The Pennant) published Rodenbach’s essays anonymously. Rodenbach maintained his contacts in Roeselare through a committee of correspondence. Their ideology was a mixture of the philosophy  Guido Gezelle, with the  romantic nationalism of  Hendrik Conscience, and the righteousness of  true belief. Additionally Rodenbach made contacts with the Flemish liberals, poet  Jan van Beers and author  Max Rooses.In 1876 Rodenbach published some essays under the pseudonym “Harold”. His book Eerste Gedichten (First Poems) was published in 1878. The rest of his work, including his verse play Gudrun, a dramatized epic of the Vikings, was not published until after his death.Rodenbach died before his 24th birthday, and almost immediately became the pre-eminent symbol of the Flemish student movement. On Rodenbach’s death, Pol de Mont took over the leadership of the “Algemene Vlaamse Studentenbond”.Rodenbach was known at the time of his death for his songs, poems and tonal-works which have remained inspiring symbols for the  Flemish movement. He was the inspiration for  Hendrik Conscience’s novel Kerels van Vlaanderen. Flandria Film made a film about him in 1930 entitled Albrecht Rodenbach and directed by Clemens De Landtsheer.

Alchemy has been practiced in Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt,  Persia, India, and China, in  Classical Greece and Rome, in Muslim civilization, and then in Europe up to the 19th century—in a complex  network of schools and philosophical systems spanning at least 2500 years.Western alchemy has always been closely connected with  Hermeticism, a philosophical and spiritual system that traces its roots to  Hermes Trismegistus, a  syncretic Egyptian-Greek deity and legendary alchemist. These two disciplines influenced the birth of  Rosicrucianism, an important  esoteric movement of the seventeenth century. In the course of the early modern period, mainstream alchemy evolved into modern chemistry.Today, the discipline is of interest mainly to historians of science and  philosophy, and for its  mystic,  esoteric, and  artistic aspects. Nevertheless, alchemy was one of the main precursors of modern sciences, and many substances and processes of ancient alchemy continue to be the mainstay of modern chemical and metallurgical industries.Although alchemy takes on many forms, in  pop culture it is most often cited in stories, films, shows, and games as the process used to change lead (or other elements) into gold.',\n",

The last famous member of an aristocratic family that fell from prominence after the  Peloponnesian War, he played a major role in the second half of that conflict as a strategic advisor, military commander, and politician.During the course of the Peloponnesian War, Alcibiades changed his allegiance on several occasions. In his native Athens in the early 410s BC, he advocated for an aggressive foreign policy, and was a prominent proponent of the  Sicilian Expedition, but fled to  Sparta after his political enemies brought charges of sacrilege against him. In Sparta, he served as a strategic advisor, proposing or supervising several major campaigns against Athens. In Sparta too, however, Alcibiades soon made powerful enemies and was forced to defect to  Persia. There, he served as an advisor to the  satrap  Tissaphernes until his political allies among the Athenians brought about his recall. He then served as an Athenian general ( strategos) for several more years, but his enemies eventually succeeded in exiling him a second time.The Sicilian expedition was Alcibiades' creation, and modern scholars have argued that, had that expedition been under Alcibiades' command instead of that of  Nicias, the expedition might not have met its eventual disastrous fate. In the years that he served Sparta, Alcibiades played a crucial role in the city's undoing; the capture of  Decelea and the revolts of several critical Athenian subjects occurred either at his suggestion or under his supervision. Once restored to his native city, however, he played a crucial role in a string of Athenian victories that eventually brought Sparta to seek a peace with Athens. He favored unconventional tactics, frequently winning cities over by treachery or negotiation rather than by siege. Alcibiades' military and political talents frequently proved valuable to whichever state currently held his allegiance, but his capacity for making powerful enemies ensured that he never remained in one place for long, and, by the end of the war that he had helped rekindle in the early 410s, his days of political relevance were a bygone memory.\",\n",

He convinced Congress to use an elastic interpretation of the Constitution to pass far-reaching laws. They included the creation of a national debt, federal assumption of the state debts, creation of a  national bank, and a system of taxes through a  tariff on imports and a  tax on whiskey that would pay for it all. He admired the British system and strongly denounced the French Revolution.Hamilton created the  Federalist party, the first American political party, which he built up using  patronage, networks of elite leaders, and aggressive newspaper editors. His great adversary was Thomas Jefferson, who opposed his urban, financial, industrially pro-British vision and, with  James Madison, created the \"republican party\" , eventually called the  Democratic-Republican Party. Hamilton retired from the Treasury in 1795 to practice law but returned to the public arena in December, 1798 as organizer of a new army; if full scale war broke out with France, the army was intended to conquer the colonies of Spain, France\\'s ally. Hamilton also used it to threaten political foes in  Virginia. He worked to defeat both John Adams and Jefferson in the  election of 1800; but when the House of Representatives deadlocked, he helped secure the election of Jefferson over  Aaron Burr.Hamilton once proposed (as recorded briefly in notes taken by James Madison) the concept of  elective monarchial  republicanism in a speech  at the  Continental Congress, although he came to doubt its possibility after the election of Jefferson. His nationalist and modernizing vision was rejected in the Jeffersonian \"Revolution of 1800.\" However, after the  War of 1812 showed the need for strong national institutions, his former opponents, led by  John C.

       " 'Alexander_the_Great': 'Alexander the Great ( Greek: Μέγας Ἀλέξανδρος, Megas Alexandros; July  356 BC– June 11,  323 BC), also known as Alexander III, king of Macedon ( 336– 323 BC), was one of the most successful military commanders in history. Before his death, he conquered most of the  world known to the ancient Greeks; he is regarded as one of the greatest military strategists and tacticians who ever lived. Alexander is also known in the  Zoroastrian  Middle Persian work  Arda Wiraz Nāmag as \"the accursed Alexander\" due to his conquest of the Persian Empire and the destruction of its capital  Persepolis. He is known as Eskandar in  Persian,  Dhul-Qarnayn (The two-horned one) in Middle Eastern traditions, al-Iskandar al-Kabeer in Arabic, Sikandar-e-azam in  Urdu, Skandar in  Pashto, Alexander Mokdon in Hebrew, and Tre-Qarnayia in  Aramaic (the two-horned one), apparently due to an image on coins minted during his rule that seemingly depicted him with the two ram\\'s horns of the Egyptian god  Ammon. He is known as Sikandar in  Urdu and Hindi, a term also used as a synonym for \"expert\" or \"extremely skilled\".Following the unification of the multiple city-states of ancient Greece under the rule of his father,  Philip II of Macedon, (a labour Alexander had to repeat twice because the southern Greeks rebelled after Philip\\'s death), Alexander would conquer the Persian Empire, including  Anatolia, Syria,  Phoenicia,  Judea,  Gaza, Egypt,  Bactria and Mesopotamia and extend the boundaries of his own  empire as far as the  Punjab. Before his death, Alexander had already made plans to also turn west and conquer Europe. Also he wanted to continue his march eastwards, in order to find the end of the world, since his boyhood tutor Aristotle, told him tales about where the land ends and the Great Outer Sea begins. Alexander integrated foreigners (non-Macedonians, non-Greeks known as the Successors) into his army and administration, leading some scholars to credit him with a \"policy of fusion.\" He encouraged marriage between his army and foreigners, and practiced it himself. After twelve years of constant military campaigning, Alexander died, possibly of malaria,  typhoid, or viral  encephalitis. His conquests ushered in centuries of Greek settlement and rule over distant areas, a period known as the  Hellenistic Age, a combination of Greek and Middle Eastern culture. Alexander himself lived on in the history and myth of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. After his death (and even during his life) his exploits inspired a literary tradition in which he appears as a legendary  hero in the tradition of Achilles.',\n",
       " 'Alfred_Hitchcock': 'Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock,  KBE ( August 13,  1899 –  April 29,  1980) was a highly influential British  director and  producer who pioneered many techniques in the  suspense and  thriller genres. He directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades, from the silent film era, through the invention of  talkies, to the  colour era. Hitchcock was among the most consistently successful and publicly recognizable directors in the world during his lifetime, and remains one of the best known and most popular directors of all time, famous for his expert and largely unrivaled control of pace and suspense throughout his movies.  Entertainment Weekly went so far as to give him the title of the greatest film director ever.Hitchcock was born and raised in London, England. While he began his directing career in London, he worked primarily in the United States beginning in 1939 and applied for U.S. citizenship in 1956. Hitchcock and his family lived in a mountaintop estate high above  Scotts Valley, California, from 1940 to 1972. He died of  renal failure in 1980.Hitchcock\\'s films draw heavily on both  fear and  fantasy, and are known for their  droll humour. They often portray innocent people caught up in circumstances beyond their control or understanding. This often involves a  transference of guilt in which the \"innocent\" character\\'s failings are transferred to another character, and magnified. Another common theme is the basic incompatibility of men and women; Hitchcock\\'s films often take a  cynical view of traditional romance. Rebecca was the only one of his films to win the  Academy Award for Best Picture, although four others were nominated. Hitchcock never won the Academy Award for Best Director. He was awarded  the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for lifetime achievement in 1967, but never personally received an  Academy Award of Merit.Until the later part of his career, Hitchcock was far more popular with film audiences than with  film critics, especially the elite British and American critics. In the late 1950s the  French New Wave critics, especially  Éric Rohmer,  Claude Chabrol, and  François Truffaut, were among the first to see and promote his films as artistic works. Hitchcock was one of the first directors to whom they applied their  auteur theory, which stresses the artistic authority of the director in the film-making process.Hitchcock\\'s innovations and vision have influenced a great number of filmmakers, producers, and actors. His influence helped start a trend for  film directors to control artistic aspects of their movies without answering to the movie\\'s  producer.',\n",

Elementary algebra is often part of the curriculum in  secondary education and provides an introduction to the basic ideas of algebra, including effects of  adding and  multiplying numbers, the concept of  variables, definition of  polynomials, along with factorization and determining their  roots.Algebra is much broader than elementary algebra and can be generalized. In addition to working directly with numbers, algebra covers working with  symbols, variables, and set  elements. Addition and multiplication are viewed as general  operations, and their precise definitions lead to structures such as groups,  rings and  fields.',\n",

       " 'Algerian_Civil_War': 'The Algerian Civil War was an armed conflict between the Algerian government and various  Islamist rebel groups which began in 1991. It is estimated to have cost between 150,000 and 200,000 lives. The conflict effectively ended with a government victory, following the surrender of the  Islamic Salvation Army and the 2002 defeat of the  Armed Islamic Group. However, low-level fighting still continues in some areas.The conflict began in  December 1991, when the government cancelled  elections after the first round results had shown that the  Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) party would win, citing fears that the FIS would end democracy. After the FIS was banned and thousands of its members arrested, Islamist  guerrillas rapidly emerged and began an armed campaign against the government and its supporters. They formed themselves into several  armed groups, principally the  Islamic Armed Movement (MIA), based in the mountains, and the  Armed Islamic Group (GIA), based in the towns. The guerrillas initially targeted the  army and police, but some groups soon started attacking civilians. In 1994, as negotiations between the government and the FIS\\'s imprisoned leadership reached their height, the GIA declared war on the FIS and its supporters, while the MIA and various smaller groups regrouped, becoming the FIS-loyalist  Islamic Salvation Army (AIS).Soon after, the talks collapsed, and new  elections were held—won by the army\\'s candidate, General  Liamine Zéroual. Conflict between the GIA and AIS intensified. Over the next few years, the GIA began a series of  massacres targeting entire neighborhoods or villages; some evidence also suggests the involvement of government forces. These massacres peaked in 1997 around the parliamentary elections, which were won by a newly created pro-Army party, the  National Democratic Rally (RND). The AIS, under attack from both sides, opted for a unilateral ceasefire with the government in 1997, while the GIA was torn apart by splits as various subdivisions objected to its new massacre policy. In 1999, following the election of a new president,  Abdelaziz Bouteflika, a new law gave amnesty to most guerrillas, motivating large numbers to \"repent\" (as it was termed) and return to normal life. The violence declined substantially, with effective victory for the government. The remnants of the GIA proper were hunted down over the next two years, and had practically disappeared by 2002.However, a splinter group of the GIA, the  Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), initially based on the fringes of  Kabylie, had formed in 1998 to dissociate itself from the massacres. However, despite its former repudiation of attacking non-combatants, targeting only army and police, they \"...eventually returned to killing civilians\" and in October of 2003, publicly endorsed  Al-Qaeda. The GSPC rejected the amnesty and has continued to fight, although many individual members have surrendered.

       " 'Allah': 'Allah is the Arabic language word referring to \"God\", \"the Lord\" and, literally according to the Qur\\'an, to the \"God of  Abraham, Isaac and  Jacob\" in the  Abrahamic religions. It does not mean \"a god\", but rather \"the Only God\", the Supreme Creator of the universe, and it is the main term for the deity in Islam. However, \"Allah\" is not restricted to just Islam, but is used by Christians and Jews in some regions.Most Arabic-speaking Muslims, Middle-Eastern Christians and Arabic-speaking Jewish Communities (including the  Yemenite Jews, several  Mizraḥi communities and some  Sephardim) use \"Allāh\" as the proper noun for \"God\". Etymologically, the name Allah is probably a contraction of the Arabic al-Ilah, “the God.” The name\\'s origin can be traced back to the earliest Semitic writings in which the word for god was Il or El, the latter being an Old Testament synonym for Yahweh. Allah is the standard Arabic word for “God” and is used by Arab Christians as well . Allāh is found in the Qur\\'an and in Arabic translations of both the  Tanakh and the  Gospels and even in the  Indonesian translations of the Bible.  Christians believe that Allāh is ath-Thalouth al-Muqaddas - The Holy Trinity, thus whole Allāh is consisted from Abu-Father, Bin-Son, and Ruh-Spirit.Outside the Arabic World, the use of \"Allāh\" is generally associated exclusively with Islam, and is used to refer specifically to the  Islamic concept of God. It is nearly the same as the Jewish conception of a single God, but differs from the Trinitarian  Christian conception of God. In Islam, the concept of one God is strictly observed. The Qu\\'ran refers to a Jewish belief in  Ezra as the Son of God, although historical Judaism is also strictly monotheistic. Islamic scholars often translate \"Allāh\" directly into English as \"God\", especially  Qur\\'an alone Muslims. Other scholars feel that \"Allāh\" should not be translated arguing that \"Allāh\" is the term for \"the Only God\" in a glorified pronunciation. This is a significant issue when  translating the Qur\\'an.According to the tradition of Islam there are  99 Names of God. They are the names of God revealed in the Qur\\'an.',\n",

       " \"Alzheimer's_disease\": \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a  neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration together with declining activities of daily living and  neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioural changes. It is the most common type of  dementia.The most striking early symptom is loss of short term memory ( amnesia), which usually manifests as minor forgetfulness that becomes steadily more pronounced with illness progression, with relative preservation of older memories. As the disorder progresses, cognitive (intellectual) impairment extends to the domains of language ( aphasia), skilled movements ( apraxia), recognition ( agnosia), and those functions (such as  decision-making and planning) closely related to the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain as they become disconnected from the  limbic system, reflecting extension of the underlying pathological process. These changes make up the essential human qualities, and thus AD is sometimes described as a disease where the victims suffer the loss of qualities that define human existence.This pathological process consists principally of  neuronal loss or  atrophy, principally in the temporoparietal cortex, but also in the frontal cortex, together with an inflammatory response to the deposition of  amyloid plaques and  neurofibrillary tangles.The ultimate cause of the disease is unknown. Genetic factors are known to be important, and dominant  mutations in three different genes have been identified that account for a much smaller number of cases of  familial, early-onset AD. For the more common form of late onset AD (LOAD), only one susceptibility gene has so far been identified called  ApoE4.\",\n",

It is sometimes known as The River Sea. The Amazon is also regarded by most geographic authorities as the  second longest river on Earth, the longest being the Nile in Africa.The  drainage area of the Amazon in Brazil, called the Amazon Basin, is the largest on Earth. If the Basin were an independent country, it would have more than twice the area of India.The quantity of fresh water released by the Amazon to the Atlantic Ocean is enormous: up to 300,000\\xa0m³ per second in the rainy season. The Amazon is responsible for a fifth of the total volume of fresh water entering the oceans worldwide. It is said that offshore of the mouth of the Amazon  potable water can be drawn from the ocean while still out of sight of the coastline, and the salinity of the ocean is notably lower a hundred miles out to sea. This mixture of fresh and salt water is known as  brackish water.This quantity of water causes the Amazon to have no clouds above the channel near its mouth, as shown in satellite images. These are usually taken in the morning, when water is colder and land is beginning to be much warmer. Above big rivers (the  Orinoco and  Caura rivers in Venezuela and many more have the same characteristic), cold waters create a high pressure air mass which make rivers easy to see through clouds. On the contrary, during afternoons, clouds cover most river channels.The main river (which is between approximately one and six miles wide) is navigable for large ocean steamers to  Manaus, 1,500 km (more than 900 miles) upriver from the mouth. Smaller ocean vessels of 3,000 tons and 5.5 m (18 ft)  draft can reach as far as  Iquitos, 3,600 km (2,250 miles) from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach 780 km (486 mi) higher as far as  Achual Point. Beyond that, small boats frequently ascend to the  Pongo de Manseriche, just above Achual Point.The Amazon drains an area of some  6,915,000km² (2,722,000 mile²), or some 40 percent of South America. It gathers its waters from 5 degrees north latitude to 20 degrees south  latitude. Its most remote sources are found on the inter-Andean plateau, just a short distance from the Pacific Ocean; and, after a course of about 6,400 km (4,000 mi) through the interior of Peru and across Brazil, it enters the Atlantic Ocean at the  equator.The Amazon has changed its drainage several times, from westward in the early  Cenozoic to its present eastward locomotion following the uplift of the Andes.',\n",

The  Union, led by  President Abraham Lincoln and the  Republican Party, opposed the expansion of slavery and rejected any right of secession. Fighting commenced on  April 12,  1861, when Confederate forces attacked a Federal military installation at  Fort Sumter in  South Carolina.During the first year, the Union asserted control of the border states and established a  naval blockade as both sides raised large armies. In 1862 the large, bloody battles began. In September 1862, Lincoln\\'s  Emancipation Proclamation made the freeing of the slaves a war goal, despite opposition from northern  Copperheads who tolerated secession and slavery. Emancipation ensured that  Britain and France would not intervene to help the Confederacy. In addition, the goal also allowed the Union to recruit African-Americans for reinforcements, a resource that the Confederacy did not dare exploit until it was too late.  War Democrats reluctantly accepted emancipation as part of total war needed to save the Union. In the East,  Robert Edward Lee rolled up a series of Confederate victories over the  Army of the Potomac, but his best general,  Thomas Jonathan \"Stonewall\" Jackson, was killed at the  Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863. Lee\\'s invasion of the North was repulsed at the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania in July 1863; he barely managed to escape back to Virginia. In the West, the  Union Navy captured the port of  New Orleans in 1862, and Ulysses S. Grant seized control of the Mississippi River by capturing  Vicksburg, Mississippi in July 1863, thus splitting the Confederacy.By 1864, long-term Union advantages in geography, manpower, industry, finance, political organization and transportation were overwhelming the Confederacy. Grant fought a number of bloody battles with Lee in Virginia in the summer of 1864. Lee won most of the battles in a tactical sense but on the whole lost strategically, as he could not replace his casualties and was forced to retreat into trenches around his capital, Richmond, Virginia. Meanwhile, William Tecumseh Sherman captured Atlanta, Georgia.  Sherman\\'s March to the Sea destroyed a hundred-mile-wide swath of Georgia. In 1865, the Confederacy collapsed after Lee surrendered to Grant at  Appomattox Court House and the slaves were freed.The full restoration of the Union was the work of a highly contentious postwar era known as  Reconstruction. The war produced about 970,000 casualties (3% of the population), including approximately 620,000 soldier deaths—two-thirds by disease.  The  causes of the war, the reasons for its outcome, and even  the name of the war itself are subjects of lingering controversy even today.

After a decisive American  victory at Saratoga that turned the tide in 1777, France, with Spain and the Netherlands as its allies, entered the war against Great Britain.

       " 'Anemia': 'Anaemia (AmE) or anaemia (BrE), from the  Greek (Ἀναιμία) meaning \"without blood\", refers to a deficiency of  red blood cells (RBCs) and/or  hemoglobin. This results in a reduced ability of blood to transfer oxygen to the  tissues, causing  hypoxia; since all human cells depend on oxygen for survival, varying degrees of anaemia can have a wide range of clinical consequences.  Hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in the red blood cells) has to be present to ensure adequate oxygenation of all body tissues and organs.The three main classes of anaemia include excessive blood loss (acutely such as a  hemorrhage or chronically through low-volume loss), excessive blood cell destruction ( hemolysis) or deficient red blood cell production (ineffective  hematopoiesis). In menstruating women, dietary iron deficiency is a common cause of deficient red blood cell production.Anemia is the most common disorder of the blood. There are several kinds of anemia, produced by a variety of underlying causes. Anaemia can be classified in a variety of ways, based on the morphology of RBCs, underlying etiologic mechanisms, and discernible clinical spectra, to mention a few.Different clinicians approach anemia in different ways; two major approaches of classifying anaemias include the \"kinetic\" approach which involves evaluating production, destruction and loss , and the \"morphologic\" approach which groups anaemia by red blood cell size. The morphologic approach uses a quickly available and cheap lab test as its starting point (the  MCV). On the other hand, focusing early on the question of production (e.g., via the  reticulocyte count) may allow the clinician more rapidly to expose cases where multiple causes of anemia coexist. Regardless of one\\'s philosophy about the classification of anaemia, however, any methodical clinical evaluation should yield equally good results.',\n",

There is no single \"Anglican Church\" with universal juridical authority, since each national or regional church has full autonomy. As the name suggests, the Anglican Communion is an association of these churches in  full communion with the Church of England (which may be regarded as the \"mother church\" of the worldwide communion), and specifically with its  primate, the Archbishop of Canterbury. With over seventy million members, the Anglican Communion is the fourth largest communion in the world, after the Roman Catholic Church the  Eastern Orthodox Churches and the  Methodists.The status of full communion means that all  rites conducted in one church are recognised by the other. Some of these churches are known as Anglican, explicitly recognising the link to England (Ecclesia Anglicana means \"Church of England\"); others, such as the  American and Scottish Episcopal churches, or the Church of Ireland, prefer a separate name. Each church has its own  doctrine and  liturgy, based in most cases on that of the Church of England; and each church has its own legislative process and overall episcopal polity, under the leadership of a local primate.The Archbishop of Canterbury, religious head of the Church of England, has no formal authority outside that jurisdiction, but is recognised as symbolic head of the worldwide communion. Among the other primates, he is  primus inter pares, or \"first among equals.\" If the Archbishop of Canterbury is compared with other religious leaders such as the Pope, therefore, it is only because of his prominent  figurehead role in the media. He has no formal authority outside his own province. Nonetheless, churches are not considered to be in the Anglican Communion unless they are in full communion with him.Although they are not considered members, some non-Anglican bodies have entered into communion with the Communion as a whole or with its constituent member churches, despite having non-Anglican origins and traditions. There are also a number of jurisdictions which do have Anglican origins and traditions but have separated from a member church of the Anglican Communion. They thus are no longer in communion with Canterbury, although some are in communion with individual provinces of the Communion. Nonetheless, these bodies self-identify as Anglican and are referred to as Anglican by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Many are part of the  Continuing Anglican Movement.

It is a radical  social movement  insofar as it aims not only to attain more  humane treatment for animals,  but also to include species other than human beings within the moral community  by giving their basic interests — for example, the interest in avoiding suffering — the same consideration as those of human beings.  The claim is that animals should no longer be regarded legally or morally as property, or treated as resources for human purposes, but should instead be regarded as  legal persons. Animal law courses are now taught in 79 out of 180 United States law schools,  and the idea of extending personhood to animals has the support of some senior legal scholars, including  Alan Dershowitz  and  Laurence Tribe of  Harvard Law School. The Seattle-based  Great Ape Project is campaigning for the United Nations to adopt a  Declaration on Great Apes, which would see gorillas,  orangutans, chimpanzees and bonobos included in a \"community of equals\" with human beings, extending to them the protection of three basic interests: the  right to life, the protection of individual liberty, and the prohibition of torture. This is seen by an increasing number of animal rights lawyers as a first step toward granting rights to other animals.Critics of the concept of animal rights argue that animals do not have the capacity to enter into a  social contract or make moral choices,  and therefore cannot be regarded as possessors of moral rights. The philosopher  Roger Scruton argues that only human beings have duties and that \"[t]he corollary is inescapable: we alone have rights.\"  Critics holding this position argue that there is nothing inherently wrong with using animals for food, as entertainment, and in research, though human beings may nevertheless have an obligation to ensure they do not suffer unnecessarily.  This position is generally called the animal welfare position, and it is held by some of the oldest of the animal protection agencies.',\n",

On  1 May  1707, when England and Scotland combined into a single  state, Anne became the first sovereign of the  Kingdom of Great Britain. She continued to reign until her death. Anne was the last monarch of the  House of Stuart; she was succeeded by a second cousin, George I, of the  House of Hanover.Anne\\'s life was marked by many crises relating to succession to the Crown. Her  Roman Catholic father, James II, had been forcibly deposed in 1688; her brother-in-law and her sister then became joint monarchs as William III and Mary II. Anne suffered from  Hughes syndrome or \\'sticky blood\\' which resulted in  miscarriages. The failure of both Anne and her sister to produce a child who could survive into adulthood precipitated a succession crisis, for, in the absence of a  Protestant heir, the Roman Catholic  James Francis Edward Stuart (the \"Old Pretender\"), son of James II, could attempt to claim the throne. It was for this reason that the  Parliament of England passed legislation allowing the Crown to pass to the  House of Hanover. When the  Parliament of Scotland refused to accept the choice of the English Parliament, various coercive tactics (such as crippling the  Scottish economy by restricting trade, see  Alien Act) were used to ensure that Scotland would co-operate. The  Act of Union 1707 (which united England and Scotland into Great Britain) was a product of subsequent  treaty negotiations.Anne\\'s reign was marked by the development of a two-party system.

With power quickly transferred over to Germany, the  Wehrmacht troops entered Austria to enforce the Anschluss. The Nazis held a plebiscite within the following month, where they received 99.73% of the vote. No fighting ever took place and the strongest voices against the annexation, particularly  Fascist Italy,  France and the United Kingdom: the  Stresa Front, were powerless or, in case of Italy, appeased. The  Allies were, on paper, committed to upholding the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which specifically prohibited the union of Austria and Germany.Nevertheless, the Anschluss was among the first major steps in Adolf Hitler's long-desired creation of an empire including German-speaking lands and territories Germany had lost after World War I. Already prior to the 1938, the  Rhineland was retaken and the  Saar region was returned to Germany after fifteen years of occupation (see: Treaty of Versailles). After the Anschluss, the predominantly German  Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia was taken, with the rest of the country becoming a  protectorate to Germany in 1939.

Anthropology is distinguished from other social-science disciplines by its emphasis on  cultural relativity, in-depth examination of context, and  cross-cultural comparisons. Some anthropologists have utilized anthropological knowledge to frame cultural critiques. This has been particularly prominent in America, from the popular attacks on  Victorianism by  Margaret Mead and  Ruth Benedict through contemporary attacks on  post-colonialism under the heading of postmodernism.

Antlions are worldwide in distribution, most common in arid and sandy habitats, and can be fairly small to very large (wingspan range of 2-15 cm). Antlions are  omnivorous. The antlion  larvae eat ants and other insects, while the adult antlion eats  pollen and  nectar.The antlion larva is often called a \"\\'doodlebug\"\\'. One theory is that it gets this name from the odd winding, spiralling trails it leaves in the sand while looking for a good location to build its trap. These trails look like someone has  doodled in the sand.The adult antlion has two pairs of long, narrow, multi-veined  wings in which the apical veins enclose regular oblong spaces, and a long, slender  abdomen. Although they greatly resemble  dragonflies or  damselflies, they belong to an entirely different  order of insects. Antlions are easily distinguished from damselflies by their longer, prominent, apically clubbed  antennae and different pattern of wing venation. They also are very feeble fliers and are normally found fluttering about in the night, in search of a mate. The adult is rarely seen in the wild because it is typically active only in the evening.',\n",

Aquarium keeping is a popular  hobby around the world, with about 60 million enthusiasts worldwide. From the 1850s, when the predecessor of the modern aquarium was first developed as a  novelty, the ranks of aquarists have swelled as more sophisticated systems including lighting and filtration systems were developed to keep aquarium fish healthy. Public aquaria reproduce the home aquarist's hobby on a grand scale — the  Osaka Aquarium, for example, boasts a tank of 5,400 m³ (1.4 million U.S. gallons) and a collection of about 580 species of aquatic life, whilst the planned  National institute for research into aquatic habitats in England would be at 40-hectares the world's largest aquarium.A wide variety of aquaria are now kept by hobbyists, ranging from a simple bowl housing a single fish to complex simulated ecosystems with carefully engineered support systems. Aquaria are usually classified as containing fresh water or  salt water and  brackish water, at tropical or cold water  temperatures. These characteristics, and others, determine the type of fish and other inhabitants that can survive and thrive in the aquarium. Inhabitants for aquaria are often collected from the wild, although there is a growing list of organisms that are bred in captivity for supply to the aquarium trade.The careful aquarist dedicates considerable effort to maintaining a tank ecology that mimics its inhabitants' natural habitat. Controlling  water quality includes managing the inflow and outflow of nutrients, most notably the management of  waste produced by tank inhabitants. The nitrogen cycle describes the flow of nitrogen from input via food, through toxic nitrogenous waste produced by tank inhabitants, to metabolism to less toxic compounds by beneficial bacteria populations. Other components in maintaining a suitable aquarium environment include appropriate species selection, management of biological loading, and good physical design. Failing to provide these conditions may invite  Fish diseases.\",\n",

The book is an attempt to portray the beliefs and  rituals of an underground religious  witchcraft tradition in  Tuscany that had survived for centuries until Leland\\'s claimed discovery of its existence in the 1890s. Scholars have disputed the veracity of this claim. Still, the book has become one of the foundational texts of  Wicca and  Neo-paganism.The text is a composite. Some of it is Leland\\'s translation into English of an original  Italian  manuscript, the Vangelo (gospel). Leland reported receiving the manuscript from his primary informant on Italian witchcraft beliefs, a woman Leland called \"Maddalena\". The rest of the material comes from Leland\\'s research on Italian folklore and traditions, including other related material from Maddalena. Leland had been informed of the Vangelo\\'s existence in 1886, but it took Maddalena eleven years to provide him with a copy. After translating and editing the material, it took another two years for the book to be published. Its fifteen chapters portray the origins, beliefs, rituals and spells of an  Italian  pagan witchcraft tradition. The central figure of that religion is the  goddess  Aradia who came to Earth to teach the practice of witchcraft to oppressed peasants in order for them to oppose their  feudal oppressors and the  Christian church.Leland\\'s work remained obscure until the 1950s, when other theories about, and claims of, \"pagan witchcraft\" survivals began to be widely discussed. Aradia began to be examined within the wider context of such claims. Scholars are divided, with some dismissing Leland\\'s assertion regarding the origins of the manuscript, and others arguing for its authenticity as a unique documentation of folk beliefs. Along with increased scholarly attention, Aradia came to play a special role in the history of  Gardnerian Wicca and its offshoots, being used as evidence that Pagan witchcraft survivals existed in Europe, and because a passage from the book\\'s first chapter was used as a part of the religion\\'s  liturgy.

Many consider him one of the greatest, if not the greatest, mathematicians in  antiquity. Carl Friedrich Gauss, himself frequently called the most influential mathematician of all time, modestly claimed that Archimedes was one of the three epoch-making mathematicians (the others being Isaac Newton and  Ferdinand Eisenstein). Apart from his fundamental theoretical contributions to maths, Archimedes also shaped the fields of physics and practical engineering, and has been called \"the greatest scientist ever\".He was a relative of the Hiero monarchy, which was the ruling family of Syracuse, a seaport kingdom. King  Hiero II, who was said to be Archimedes\\'s uncle, commissioned him to design and fabricate a new class of ships for his navy, which were crucial for the preservation of the ruling class in Syracuse. Hiero had promised large caches of grain to the Romans in the north in return for peace. Faced with war when unable to present the promised amount, Hiero commissioned Archimedes to develop a large luxury/supply/war barge in order to serve the changing requirements of his navy. It is rumored that the Archimedes Screw was actually an invention of happenstance, as he needed a tool to remove bilge water. The ship, named Syracusia, after its nation, was huge, and its construction caused stupor in the Greek world.He is credited with many inventions and discoveries, some of which we still use today, like his  Archimedes screw. He was famous for his compound pulley, a system of pulleys used to lift heavy loads such as ships. He made several war machines for his patron and friend King Hiero II. He did a lot of work in geometry, which included finding the surface areas and volumes of solids accurately. The work that has made Archimedes famous is his theory of floating bodies.

Architectural design usually must address both feasibility and  cost for the  builder, as well as function and aesthetics for the  user.Planned architecture often  manipulates  space,  volume,  texture, light,  shadow, or abstract elements in order to achieve pleasing aesthetics. This distinguishes it from  applied science or engineering, which usually concentrate more on the functional and feasibility aspects of the design of constructions or structures.In the field of building architecture, the skills demanded of an architect range from the more complex, such as for a  hospital or a  stadium, to the apparently simpler, such as planning  residential houses. Many architectural works may be seen also as cultural and political  symbols, and/or works of art.

To process  input/output (I/O) requests it uses  packet-driven I/O which utilises  I/O request packets (IRPs) and  asynchronous I/O. Starting with Windows XP, Microsoft began building in 64-bit support into their operating systems — before this their operating systems were based on a 32-bit model. The architecture of Windows NT is highly modular, and consists of two main layers: a  user mode and a  kernel mode. Programs and subsystems in user mode are limited in terms of what system resources they have access to, while the kernel mode has unrestricted access to the system memory and external devices. The  kernels of the operating systems in this line are all known as  hybrid kernels - although it is worth noting that this term is disputed, with the claim that the kernel is essentially a  monolithic kernel that is structured somewhat like a  microkernel. The architecture is comprised of a hybrid kernel,  Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), drivers, and Executive, which all exist in kernel mode  . The higher-level services are implemented by the executive.User mode in the Windows NT line is made of subsystems capable of passing I/O requests to the appropriate kernel mode  software drivers by using the I/O manager. Two subsystems make up the user mode layer of Windows 2000: the Environment subsystem (runs applications written for many different types of operating systems), and the Integral subsystem (operates system specific functions on behalf of the environment subsystem). Kernel mode in Windows 2000 has full access to the hardware and system resources of the computer. The kernel mode stops user mode services and applications from accessing critical areas of the operating system that they should not have access to.The Executive interfaces with all the user mode subsystems. It deals with I/O, object management, security and process management. The kernel sits between the  Hardware Abstraction Layer and the Executive to provide multiprocessor synchronization, thread and interrupt scheduling and dispatching, and trap handling and exception dispatching. The kernel is also responsible for initialising device drivers at bootup. Kernel mode drivers exist in three levels: highest level drivers, intermediate drivers and low level drivers.  Windows Driver Model (WDM) exists in the intermediate layer and was mainly designed to be binary and source compatible between  Windows 98 and Windows 2000. The lowest level drivers are either legacy  Windows NT device drivers that control a device directly or can be a  PnP hardware bus.',\n",

       " 'Arctic': 'The Arctic is the  region around the Earth\\'s  North Pole, opposite the Antarctic region around the  South Pole. In the  northern hemisphere, the Arctic includes the Arctic Ocean (which overlies the North Pole) and parts of Canada, Greenland (a territory of Denmark), Russia, the United States ( Alaska), Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Finland. The word Arctic comes from the Greek word arktos, which means bear. This is due to the location of the constellation  Ursa Major, the \"Great Bear\", above the Arctic region.There are numerous definitions of the Arctic region. The boundary is generally considered to be north of the Arctic Circle (66° 33’N), which is the approximate limit of the  midnight sun and the  polar night. Other definitions are based on climate and ecology, such as the 10°C (50°F) July  isotherm, which roughly corresponds to the  tree line in most of the Arctic. Socially and politically, the Arctic region includes the northern territories of the eight Arctic states, including  Lapland, although by natural science definitions much of this territory is considered  subarctic.The Arctic region consists of a vast  ice-covered ocean (which is sometimes considered to be a northern arm of the Atlantic Ocean) surrounded by treeless, frozen ground. Life in the Arctic includes organisms living in the ice, fish and marine mammals, birds, land animals, and human societies.The Arctic region is a unique area among Earth\\'s ecosystems. The cultures in the region and the Arctic indigenous peoples have adapted to its cold and extreme conditions. In climate change research, the Arctic region is often considered an early warning system for the planet.',\n",
       " 'Arctic_Circle': \"The Arctic Circle is one of the five major  circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth. This is the parallel of  latitude that (in 2000) runs 66 ° 33′ 39″ (or 66.56083 °) north of the  Equator. Everything north of this circle is known as the Arctic, and the zone just to the south of this circle is the Northern Temperate Zone.The Arctic Circle marks the southern extremity of the  polar day (24 hour sunlit day) of the  summer solstice in June and the  polar night (24 hour sunless night) of the  winter solstice in December. Within the Arctic Circle, the Sun is above the  horizon for 24 continuous  hours at least once per  year, in conjunction with the Arctic's  Summer Solstice - this is often referred to in local  vernacular as  midnight sun. Likewise, in conjunction with the Arctic’s  Winter Solstice, the Arctic sun will be below the horizon for at least 24 continuous hours. (In fact, because of the  atmospheric refraction and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point, part of the midnight sun may be seen at the night of the summer solstice up to about 50′ (90 km) south of the geometric arctic circle; similarly, at the day of the winter solstice part of the sun may be seen up to about 50′ north of the geometric arctic circle. This is true at sea level; these limits increase with elevation above sea level, however in mountainous regions there is often no direct view of the horizon.)The position of the Arctic Circle is determined by the  axial tilt (angle) of the polar axis of rotation of the Earth on the  ecliptic. This angle is not constant, but has a complex motion determined by many cycles of short to very long periods. At 2000, its mean value was about 23°26′21″. Due to  nutation the tilt oscillates over 9″ (about 280  m on the surface) over a period of 18.6 years. The main long-term cycle has a period of 41,000 years and an amplitude of about 0.68°, or 76 km on the surface. Currently the tilt is decreasing by about 0.47″ per year, so the Arctic Circle is moving north by about 15 m per year.

Originally established in 2002, the band currently consists of  Alex Turner on lead vocals and guitar,  Jamie Cook on rhythm guitar,  Matt Helders on drums and backing vocals and  Nick O\\'Malley on bass guitar, a position formerly held by  Andy Nicholson.Unlike many of their contemporaries, who were marketed and advertised extensively by  record labels, Arctic Monkeys achieved their success through fan-made  demo tapes and online  file-sharing, culminating in fans singing along at gigs of songs which had never been officially released, leading media commentators to discuss the possibility of a sea change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed. The band resisted signing to a major record label, even banning  talent scouts from gigs. Eventually, the band signed to  independent record label  Domino Records, releasing their debut album  Whatever People Say I Am, That\\'s What I\\'m Not, which debuted straight at number one and broke the record for the largest first week sales of a debut album in UK history. The band subsequently won several major music prizes for the album, including the 2006  Mercury Prize, \"Best New Act\" at the  2006 Brit Awards and \"Best New Band\" and \"Best British Band\" at the  NME Awards.The overnight success of the band and the gritty, realistic nature of the lyrics of songs such as \"When The Sun Goes Down\" has led to the band being described as the \"yardstick for all that is current and cool\".

Even though the  International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, oceanographers may call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it as one of the  mediterranean seas of the Atlantic Ocean.Much of the ocean is covered by  sea ice, either during the colder months or year-round. Little marine life exists where the ocean surface is covered with ice throughout the year. The Arctic Ocean's  temperature and  salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major seas, due to low  evaporation, as well as limited outflow to the world ocean with heavy freshwater inflow.The greatest inflow of water comes from the Atlantic by way of the  Norwegian Current, which then flows along the Eurasian coast. Water also enters from the Pacific via the Bering Strait. The  East Greenland Current carries the major outflow. Ice covers most of the ocean surface year-round, causing subfreezing temperatures much of the time. The Arctic is a major source of very cold air that inevitably moves toward the  equator, meeting with warmer air in the middle  latitudes and causing rain and snow. Marine life abounds in open areas, especially the more southerly waters. The ocean's major ports are the Russian cities of  Murmansk and  Arkhangelsk. The Arctic Ocean is important as the shortest air route between the Pacific coast of North America and Europe overflies it.\",\n",

Parents feed them fish for a considerable time, and help them fly south to winter.Arctic Terns are long-lived birds, with many reaching twenty years of age. They eat mainly fish and small marine invertebrates. The species is abundant, with an estimated one million individuals. While the trend in the number of individuals in the species as a whole is not known, exploitation in the past has reduced this bird's numbers in the southern reaches of its range.\",\n",

He fell into a  coma, and has not regained consciousness.During his lengthy career, Sharon was a highly controversial figure among many factions, both inside and outside Israel. His supporters view him as a leader who strove to establish peace without sacrificing Israel's security. Many Israelis likewise consider him a  war hero who helped defend the country during some of its greatest struggles. Some of his critics have sought to prosecute him as a  war criminal for alleged crimes related to the  Sabra and Shatila massacre during the  1982 Lebanon War, for which the  Kahan Commission held him both 'indirectly' and 'personally' responsible. While no Israelis participated in the massacre, the investigation found that Sharon was personally responsible due to negligence and complacency.

He sought to consolidate royal power and crush domestic factions. By restraining the power of the nobility, he transformed France into a strong,  centralized state. His chief  foreign policy objective was to check the power of the Austro-Spanish  Habsburg dynasty. Although he was a Roman Catholic cardinal, he did not hesitate to make alliances with  Protestant rulers in attempting to achieve this goal. His tenure was marked by the  Thirty Years\\' War that engulfed Europe.As an advocate for  Samuel de Champlain and of the retention of  Québec, he founded the  Compagnie des Cent-Associés and saw the  Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye return Québec to French rule under Champlain, after the settlement had been captured by the  Kirkes in 1629. This in part allowed the colony to eventually develop into the heartland of  Francophone culture in North America.Richelieu was also famous for his patronage of the arts; most notably, he founded the  Académie française, the  learned society responsible for matters pertaining to the French language.

There is no general agreed-upon definition of art, since defining the boundaries of \"art\" is subjective, but the  impetus for art is often called human  creativity.An artwork is normally assessed in quality by the amount of stimulation it brings about. The impact it has on people, the number of people that can relate to it, the degree of their appreciation, and the effect or influence it has or has had in the past, all accumulate to the \\'degree of art.\\' Most artworks that are widely considered to be \"masterpieces\" possess these attributes.Something is not generally considered \\'art\\' when it stimulates only the senses, or only the mind, or when it has a different primary purpose than doing so. However, some contemporary art challenges this idea.As such, something can be deemed art in totality, or as an element of some object. For example, a painting may be a pure art, while a chair, though designed to be sat in, may include artistic elements. Art that has less functional value or intention may be referred to as fine art, while objects of artistic merit but serve a functional purpose may be referred to as  craft. Paradoxically, an object may be characterized by the intentions (or lack thereof) of its creator, regardless of its apparent purpose; a cup (which ostensibly can be used as a container) may be considered art if intended solely as an ornament, while a painting may be deemed craft if mass-produced. In the 1800s, art was primarily concerned with ideas of \"Truth\" and \"Beauty.\" There was a radical break in the thinking about art in the early 1900s with the arrival of  Modernism, and then in the late 1900s with the advent of  Postmodernism.  Clement Greenberg\\'s 1960 article \"Modernist Painting\" defined Modern Art as \"the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself.\" Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting. \"Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; Modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of painting -- the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment -- were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly. Under Modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors, and were acknowledged openly.\" Though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists, this definition of Modern Art underlies most of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the twentieth century and early twenty-first century. The art of  Marcel Duchamp becomes clear when seen within this context; when submitting a urinal, titled fountain, to the Society of Independent Artists exhibit in 1917 he was critiquing the art exhibition using its own methods.',\n",

       " 'Arts_and_crafts': 'Arts and crafts comprise a whole host of activities and hobbies that are related to making things with one\\'s own hands and skill. These can be sub-divided into  handicrafts or \"traditional crafts\" (doing things the old way) and the rest. Some crafts have been practised for centuries, while others are modern inventions, or popularisations of crafts which were originally practiced in a very small geographic area.Additionally, this term refers to the  Arts and Crafts movement which was a social revolution veiled in a design movement of the late 19th and early 20th century, whose proponents included  William Morris and  Edwin Lutyens. They believed that medieval craftsmen achieved a joy and fulfillment in the excellence of their work, which they strove to emulate.These activities are called  crafts because originally many of them were professions under the guild system. Adolescents were apprenticed to a master-craftsman, and they refined their skills over a period of years in exchange for low wages. By the time their training was complete, they were well-equipped to set up in trade for themselves, earning their living with the skill that could be traded directly within the community, often for goods and services. The Industrial Revolution and the increasing mechanisation of production processes gradually reduced or eliminated many of the roles professional craftspeople played, and today \\'crafts\\' are most commonly seen as a form of  hobby or art.Most crafts require a combination of skill, speed, and patience, but they can also be learnt on a more basic level by virtually anyone. Many  community centres and schools run evening or day classes and workshops offering to teach basic craft skills in a short period of time. Many of these crafts become extremely popular for brief periods of time (a few months, or a few years), spreading rapidly among the crafting population as everyone emulates the first examples.The term craft also refers to the products of artistic production or creation that require a high degree of tacit knowledge, are highly technical, require specialized equipment and/or facilities to produce, involve  manual labour or a  blue-collar work ethic, are accessible to the general public and are constructed from materials with histories that exceed the boundaries of western art history, such as  ceramics, glass,  textiles, metal and wood. These products are produced within a specific  community of practice and while they differ from the products produced within the communities of art and design, the boundaries of such often overlap resulting in hybrid objects. Additionally, as the interpretation and validation of art is frequently a matter of context, an audience may perceive crafted objects as art objects when these objects are viewed within an art context, such as in a museum or in a position of prominence in one’s home.The term can also refer to the useful  rural crafts of the agricultural countryside.

Today the European asp,  Vipera aspis, is the only snake correctly referred to as an asp.The asp was a symbol of royalty in dynastic and Roman Egypt. Extremely poisonous, the asp was often used as a means of execution for criminals who had attained a favoured status and were thought deserving of a death more dignified than typical executions. The Greeks also used them for executions.According to  Plutarch (quoted by  Ussher), Cleopatra tested various deadly poisons on condemned persons and animals for daily entertainment. She concluded that the bite of the asp was the best way to die. It brought a sleepiness and heaviness without spasms of pain. Later she may have used this method to kill herself. Yet some people think that Cleopatra was bitten by a  horned viper.In Shakespeare's play, Cleopatra kills herself by the bite of an asp after the death of her lover, Mark Antony.\",\n",
       " 'Asparagus': 'Asparagus is a type of vegetable obtained from one species within the genus  Asparagus, specifically the young  shoots of Asparagus officinalis. It has been used from very early times as a culinary vegetable, owing to its delicate flavour and  diuretic properties. There is a  recipe for cooking asparagus in the oldest surviving book of recipes,  Apicius\\'s 3rd century CE  De re coquinaria, Book III.White asparagus is cultivated by denying the plants light and increasing the amount of ultraviolet light exposed to the plants while they are being grown.The English word \"asparagus\" derives from classical  Latin, but the plant was once known in English as sperage, from the  Medieval Latin sparagus. This term itself derives from the  Greek aspharagos or asparagos, and the Greek term originates from the  Persian asparag, meaning \"sprout\" or \"shoot.\" The original Latin name has now supplanted the English word. Asparagus was also corrupted in some places to \"sparrow grass\"; indeed,  John Walker stated in  1791 that \"Sparrow-grass is so general that asparagus has an air of stiffness and pedantry.\"  It is commonly known in fruit retail circles as \"Sparrows Guts\", etymologically distinct from the old term \"sparrow grass\" showing convergent language evolution.In their simplest form, the shoots are boiled or steamed until tender and served with a light sauce like  hollandaise or melted butter or a drizzle of olive oil with a dusting of  Parmesan cheese. A refinement is to tie the shoots into sheaves and stand them so that the lower part of the stalks are boiled, while the more tender heads are steamed. Tall cylindrical asparagus cooking pots have liners with handles and perforated bases to make this process foolproof.Unlike most vegetables, where the smaller and thinner are the more tender, thick asparagus stalks have more tender volume to the proportion of skin. When asparagus have been too long in the market, the cut ends will have dried and gone slightly  concave. The best asparagus are picked and washed while the water comes to the boil. Meticulous cooks scrape asparagus stalks with a vegetable peeler, stroking away from the head, and refresh them in ice-cold water before steaming them; the peel is often added back to the cooking water and removed only after the asparagus is done, this is supposed to prevent diluting the flavor. Small or full-sized stalks can be made into  asparagus soup. Cantonese restaurants in the United States often serve asparagus stir-fried with chicken,  shrimp, or  beef. Asparagus is one of few foods which is considered acceptable to eat with the hands in polite company, although this is more common in Europe.',\n",
       " 'Asperger_syndrome': \"Asperger syndrome — also referred to as Asperger's syndrome, Asperger's, or just AS — is one of five  neurobiological  pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) that is characterized by deficiencies in  social and  communication skills. It is considered to be part of the  autistic spectrum and is differentiated from other PDDs and from high functioning autism (HFA) in that early development is normal and there is no language delay. It is possible for people with AS to have learning disabilities concurrently with Asperger syndrome. In these cases, differential diagnosis is essential to identify subsequent support requirements. Conversely, IQ tests may show normal or superior  intelligence, and standard  language development compared with classical autism. The  diagnosis of AS is complicated by the lack of adoption of a standardized diagnostic screen, and, instead, the use of several different screening instruments and sets of diagnostic criteria. The exact  cause of AS is unknown and the  prevalence is not firmly established, due partly to the use of differing sets of diagnostic criteria.Asperger syndrome was named in honour of  Hans Asperger (1906-1980), an Austrian  psychiatrist and  pediatrician, by researcher  Lorna Wing, who first used the  eponym in a 1981 paper. In 1994, AS was recognized in the 4th edition of the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as Asperger's Disorder.AS is often not identified in early childhood, and many individuals do not receive diagnosis until after puberty or when they are adults. Assistance for core symptoms of AS consists of therapies that apply behaviour management strategies and address poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness. Many individuals with AS can adopt strategies for coping and do lead fulfilling lives - being gainfully employed, getting married or having successful relationships, and having families. In most cases, they are aware of their differences and recognize when they need support to maintain an independent life. There are instances where adults do not realize that they have AS personalities until they are having difficulties with relationships and/or attending relationship counseling. Recognition of the very literal and logical thought processes that are symptomatic of AS can be a tremendous help to both partners in a close/family relationship.\",\n",

The term asteroid is generally used to indicate a diverse group of small celestial bodies that drift in the solar system in orbit around the Sun. Asteroid (Greek for \"star-like\") is the word used most in the English literature for  minor planets, which has been the term preferred by the  International Astronomical Union; some other languages prefer planetoid (Greek: \"planet-like\"), because it more accurately describes what they are. In late  August 2006, the IAU introduced the term \" small solar system bodies\" (SSSBs), which includes most objects thusfar classified as minor planets, as well as comets. At the same time they introduced the term  dwarf planet for the largest minor planets. This article deals specifically with the minor planets that orbit in the inner solar system (roughly up to the orbit of  Jupiter). For other types of objects, such as  comets,  Trans-Neptunian objects, and  Centaurs, see  Small solar system body.The first asteroid to be discovered, Ceres, is the largest asteroid known to date and is now classified as a  dwarf planet. All others are currently classified as  small solar system bodies. The vast majority of asteroids are found within the main  asteroid belt, with  elliptical orbits between those of  Mars and Jupiter. It is thought that these asteroids are remnants of the  protoplanetary disc, and in this region the incorporation of protoplanetary remnants into the planets was prevented by large gravitational perturbations induced by Jupiter during the formative period of the solar system. Some asteroids have  moons or are found in pairs known as  binary systems.',\n",

In children, the most common triggers are viral illnesses such as those that cause the common cold. This airway narrowing causes  symptoms such as  wheezing,  shortness of breath, chest tightness, and  coughing, which respond to  bronchodilators. Between episodes, most patients feel fine.The disorder is a  chronic or recurring  inflammatory condition in which the  airways develop increased responsiveness to various stimuli, characterized by  bronchial hyper-responsiveness,  inflammation, increased  mucus production, and intermittent airway obstruction. The symptoms of asthma, which can range from mild to life threatening, can usually be controlled with a combination of  drugs and environmental changes.Public attention in the  developed world has recently focused on asthma because of its rapidly increasing  prevalence, affecting up to one in four urban children. Susceptibility to asthma can be explained in part by genetic factors, but no clear pattern of  inheritance has been found. Asthma is a complex disease that is influenced by multiple genetic,  developmental, and environmental factors, which interact to produce the overall condition.',\n",

A practitioner of astrology is called an  astrologer, or, less often, an astrologist. Historically, the term mathematicus was used to denote a person proficient in astrology, astronomy, and mathematics.Although the two fields share a  common origin, modern astronomy is entirely distinct from astrology. While astronomy is the scientific study of astronomical objects and phenomena, the practice of astrology is concerned with the correlation of heavenly bodies (which historically involved measurement of the celestial sphere) with earthly and human affairs. Astrology is variously considered by its proponents to be a  symbolic language, a form of art, science, or  divination. The  scientific community generally considers astrology to be a  pseudoscience or  superstition as it has failed empirical tests in controlled studies.The word astrology is derived from the  Greek αστρολογία, from άστρον (astron, \"star\") and λόγος ( logos, \"word\"). The -λογία suffix is written in English as  -logy, \"study\" or \"discipline\".',\n",

It is concerned with the evolution, physics, chemistry, meteorology,and motion of celestial objects, as well as the  formation and development of the universe.Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences. Astronomers of early civilizations performed methodical observations of the night sky, and astronomical artifacts have been found from much earlier periods. However, it required the invention of the telescope before astronomy developed into a modern science.Since the 20th century, the field of professional astronomy has split into  observational astronomy and  theoretical astrophysics. Observational astronomy is concerned with acquiring data, which involves building and maintaining instruments, as well as processing the results. Theoretical astrophysics is concerned with ascertaining the observational implications of computer or analytic models. The two fields complement each other, with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain the observational results. Astronomical observations can be used to test fundamental theories in physics, such as  general relativity.Historically,  amateur astronomers have contributed to many important astronomical discoveries, and astronomy is one of the few sciences where amateurs can still play an active role, especially in the discovery and observation of transient phenomena.Modern astronomy is not to be confused with astrology, the belief system that claims human affairs are correlated with the positions of celestial objects.

New articles have links to electronic versions hosted at the journal's webpage, but these are typically available only by subscription (which most astronomy research facilities have).ADS is an extremely powerful research tool, and has had a significant impact on the efficiency of astronomical research since it was launched in 1992. Literature searches which previously would have taken days or weeks can now be carried out in seconds, via the sophisticated ADS search engine, which is custom-built for astronomical needs. Studies have found that the benefit to astronomy of the ADS is equivalent to several hundred million  US dollars annually, and the system is estimated to have tripled the readership of astronomical  journals.Use of ADS is almost universal among astronomers worldwide, and therefore ADS usage statistics can be used to analyse global trends in astronomical research. They have revealed that the amount of research an astronomer carries out is related to the  GDP per capita of the country in which they are based and that the number of astronomers in a country is proportional to the GDP of that country, so the amount of research done in a country is proportional to the square of its GDP divided by its  population.\",\n",

It is commonly defined as the positive denial of theism (ie. the assertion that deities do not exist), or the deliberate rejection of  theism (i.e., the refusal to believe in the existence of deities). However, others—including most atheistic philosophers and groups—define atheism as the simple absence of belief in deities (cf.  nontheism), thereby designating many agnostics, and people who have never heard of gods, such as the  unchurched or newborn children, as atheists as well. In recent years, some atheists have adopted the terms  strong and weak atheism to clarify whether they consider their stance one of positive belief no gods exist, or of negative unbelief.Many  self-described atheists share common  skeptical concerns regarding empirical evidence for spiritual or  supernatural claims. They cite a lack of evidence for the existence of deities. Other rationales for atheism range from the personal to the philosophical to the social to the historical. Additionally, while atheists tend to accept  secular philosophies such as humanism,  naturalism and  materialism, they do not necessarily adhere to any one particular  ideology, nor does atheism have any institutionalized rituals or behaviors.Atheism is very often equated with  irreligion or nonspirituality in Western culture, but they are not the same. Some religious and spiritual beliefs, such as several forms of  Buddhism, have been described by outside observers as conforming to the broader, negative definition of atheism due to their lack of any participating deities. Atheism is also sometimes erroneously equated with  antitheism (opposition to theism) or  antireligion (opposition to religion).

       " 'Athena': 'In Greek mythology, Athena ( Greek: Ἀθηνᾶ, Athēnâ, or Ἀθήνη, Athénē;  Doric: Ἀσάνα, Asána) was the goddess of civilization, specifically  wisdom,  weaving, and  crafts . Athena\\'s wisdom encompasses the technical knowledge employed in weaving, metal-working, but also includes the cunning intelligence ( metis) of such figures as Odysseus. The  owl and the  olive tree are sacred to her.She is attended by an owl, wears a goatskin breastplate called the  Aegis given to her by her father, Zeus, and is accompanied by the goddess of victory,  Nike. She is often shown helmeted and with a shield bearing the  Gorgon  Medusa\\'s head, a votive gift of  Perseus. Athena is an armed warrior goddess, and appears in Greek mythology as a helper of many heroes, including Heracles,  Jason, and Odysseus. She never had a consort or lover, and thus was often known as Athena Parthenos (\"Athena the virgin\"), hence her most famous temple, the Parthenon, on the  Acropolis in Athens. In her role as a protector of the city, Athena was worshipped throughout the Greek world as Athena Polias (\"Athena of the city\"). She had a special relationship with Athens, as is shown by the etymological connection of the names of the goddess and the city.Athena is associated with Athens, a plural name because it was the place where she presided over her sisterhood, the Athenai, in earliest times. Athena was probably already a goddess in the Aegean in prehistoric times. There is evidence that in early times, Athena was an owl herself, or a  bird goddess in general. In Book 3 of the Odyssey, she takes the form of a  sea-eagle. Her tasseled  aegis may be the remnants of wings: she is depicted with wings on Archaic  red-figure pottery.In the  Olympian pantheon, Athena was remade as the favorite daughter of Zeus, born fully armed from his forehead after he swallowed her mother, Metis. The story of her birth comes in several versions. In the one most commonly cited, Zeus lay with  Metis, the goddess of crafty thought and wisdom, but immediately feared the consequences. It had been prophesied that Metis would bear children more powerful than the sire, even Zeus himself. In order to forestall these dire consequences, Zeus transformed Metis into a fly and swallowed her immediately after lying with her. He was too late: Metis had already conceived a child. Metis immediately began making a helmet and robe for her fetal daughter. The hammering as she made the helmet caused Zeus great pain and  Prometheus,  Hephaestus,  Hermes or  Palaemon (depending on the sources examined) cleaved Zeus\\'s head with the double-headed Minoan axe (the  labrys of the Great Goddess). Athena leaped from Zeus\\'s head, fully grown and armed, and Zeus was none the worse for the experience.Fragments attributed to the semi-legendary  Phoenician historian  Sanchuniathon, said to have written before the  Trojan war, make Athena instead the daughter of  Cronus, a king of  Byblos who is said to have visited \\'the inhabitable world\\' and bequeathed  Attica to Athena.',\n",

Most slaves were transported from  West Africa and  Central Africa to the  New World. While Europeans obtained most slaves through coastal trade with African trading states, some slaves were captured through raids and kidnapping. Some contemporary historians estimate that 12 million Africans arrived in the new world, making it one of the largest forced migrations in human history. However, some estimate that the number is as high as 25 to 40 million . The slave-trade is sometimes called the  Maafa by African and  African-American scholars, meaning \"holocaust\" or \"great disaster\" in  Kiswahili. The slaves were one element of a three-part  economic cycle—the  Triangular Trade and its  Middle Passage—which ultimately involved four continents, four  centuries and millions of people.',\n",

According to him this island, lying \"beyond the  pillars of Hercules\", was a naval power, having conquered many parts of  western Europe and Africa. Soon after a failed invasion of Athens, Atlantis sank in the waves \"in a single day and night of misfortune\" due to a natural catastrophe which happened 9,000 years before Plato\\'s time.As a story embedded in Plato\\'s dialogues, Atlantis is mostly seen as a myth created by Plato to back up a previously invented theory with real facts. Some scholars express the opinion that Plato intended to tell real history. Although the function of the story of Atlantis seems to be clear to most scholars, they dispute whether and how much Plato\\'s account was inspired by older traditions. Some scholars argue Plato drew upon memories of past events such as the  Thera eruption or the Trojan War, while others insist that he took inspiration of contemporary events like the destruction of  Helike in  373 BC or the failed  Athenian invasion of Sicily in 415–413 BC.The possible existence of Atlantis was actively discussed throughout the  classical antiquity, but it was usually rejected and occasionally parodied. While basically unknown during the Middle Ages, the story of Atlantis was rediscovered by  Humanists at the very beginning of modern times. Plato\\'s description inspired the utopian works of several Renaissance writers, like Francis Bacon\\'s \" New Atlantis\".

In  neurological  pathology, ADHD is currently considered to be a  chronic  syndrome for which no medical cure is available. ADHD is believed to affect between 3-5% of the United States population, including both children and adults.Much  controversy surrounds the diagnosis of ADHD, such as whether or not the diagnosis denotes a  disability in its traditional sense, or simply describes the neurological property of an individual. There is also a sizable minority of clinicians who believe that the condition is not biological, but psychological in origin. Those who believe that ADHD is a traditional disability or disorder often debate over how it should be treated, if at all. According to a majority of medical research in the United States, as well as other countries, ADHD is today generally regarded to be a non-curable neurological disorder for which, however, a wide range of effective treatments are available. Methods of treatment usually involve some combination of medication,  psychotherapy, and other techniques. Some patients are able to control their symptoms over time, without the use of medication. Other individuals who meet the diagnostic criteria of ADHD do not consider themselves to be handicapped by the disorder and therefore may remain undiagnosed or, after a positive diagnosis, untreated.ADHD is most commonly diagnosed in children and, over the past decade, has been increasingly diagnosed in adults. It is believed that around 60% of children diagnosed with ADHD retain the disorder as adults.\",\n",

His empire stretched from Germany and the Netherlands to the  Ural river and from the Danube River to Poland and Estonia.

       " 'Augustan_literature': \"Augustan literature is a  style of  English literature whose origins correspond roughly with the reigns of Queen Anne,  King George I, and  George II. In contemporary critical parlance, it refers to the literature of 1700 up to approximately 1760 (or, for some, 1789). It is a literary  epoch that featured the rapid development of the novel, an explosion in  satire, the mutation of drama from  political satire into  melodrama, and an evolution toward poetry of personal exploration. In philosophy, it was an age increasingly dominated by empiricism, while in the writings of political-economy it marked the evolution of mercantilism as a formal philosophy, the development of capitalism, and the triumph of  trade.The chronological anchors of the era are generally vague, largely since the label's origin in  contemporary 18th century criticism has made it a shorthand designation for a somewhat nebulous age of satire. This new  Augustan period exhibited exceptionally bold  political writings in all  genres, with the satires of the age marked by an arch, ironic pose, full of nuance, and a superficial air of dignified calm that hid sharp criticisms beneath.As literacy (and  London's population, especially) grew, literature began to appear from all over the  kingdom. Authors gradually began to accept literature that went in unique directions rather than the formerly monolithic conventions and, through this, slowly began to honour and recreate various folk compositions. Beneath the appearance of a placid and highly regulated series of writing modes, many developments of the later  Romantic era were beginning to take place — while politically, philosophically, and literarily,  modern  consciousness was being hewn out of hitherto  feudal and  courtly notions of ages past.\",\n",
       " 'Auguste_Rodin': \"Auguste Rodin (born François-Auguste-René Rodin;  November 12,  1840 –  November 17,  1917) was a French artist, most famous as a sculptor. He was the preeminent French sculptor of his time, and remains one of the few sculptors with broad name recognition outside the visual arts community.Although Rodin is generally considered the progenitor of modern sculpture, he did not set out to rebel against the past. He was schooled traditionally in Paris's  École des Beaux-Arts system, took a craftsman-like approach to his work, and desired academic recognition. Sculpturally, he possessed a unique ability to model in clay a complex, turbulent, deeply pocketed surface.Many of Rodin's most notable sculptures were roundly criticized during his lifetime. They clashed with the predominant figure sculpture tradition, in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic. Rodin's most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and  allegory, modelled the human body with high realism, and celebrated individual character and physicality. Rodin was sensitive to the controversy about his work, but did not change his style, and successive works brought increasing favour from the government and the artistic community.From the unexpected realism of his first major figure—inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy—to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, Rodin's reputation grew. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Wealthy private clients sought Rodin's work after his  World's Fair exhibit, and he kept company with a variety of high-profile intellectuals and artists. His sculpture suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917, but within a few decades his legacy solidified.\",\n",

The winner is the team who has kicked the highest total score by the end of the match.There are several different ways to advance the ball, including kicking and hand passing. When hand passing one hand must be used to hold the ball and the other to hit it — throwing the ball is not allowed. Players running with the ball must bounce or touch it on the ground. There is no  offside rule and players can roam the field freely. Australian rules is a  contact sport. Possession of the ball is in dispute at all times except when a  free kick is paid. Players who hold on to the ball too long are penalised if they are  tackled by an opposition player who is then rewarded, whilst players who catch a ball (known as a  mark) from a kick exceeding 15 metres are awarded uncontested possession.

The  ICD-10 also requires symptoms to be \"manifest before the age of three years.\" Autism is often not  physiologically obvious, in that outward appearance may not indicate a disorder, and diagnosis typically comes from a complete physical and  neurological evaluation.There have been large increases in diagnosed autism, for reasons that are heavily debated by  researchers in psychology and related fields within the  scientific community. Some believe this increase is largely due to changed diagnostic criteria and/or societal factors, while others think the reason is environmental. The United States  Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimate the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders to be between 2 and 6 per 1000 births (i.e., between 1 in 500 and 1 in 166 births). The  National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) states the \"best conservative estimate\" as 1 in 1000.Although the specific  causes of autism are unknown, there is a large database of links between autism and genetic loci that span every chromosome. Further, observations such as autistic children having generally larger head circumferences are intriguing, but their roles in the disorder are unclear. Research continues, however; researchers at the  University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, for example, claim to have found a link between autism, abnormal blood vessel function, and oxidative stress (the result of higher levels of  free radicals). This suggests that doors may be opened to new medical therapies if researchers can find more evidence linking decreased blood flow to the brain and oxidative stress with the pathology of autism.With early intervention, intense therapies (most notably  Applied Behavioural Analysis), practice, and schooling, some children diagnosed with autism may improve on their skills to the point of neurotypical children.

The actual power of the monarch may be limited. Historically, many monarchs ruled autocratically (see  absolute monarchy) but eventually their power was diminished and dissolved with the introduction of  constitutions giving the people the power to make decisions for themselves through elected bodies of government.The autocrat needs some kind of power structure to rule. Only a boss of a street gang or a barbarian chieftain can truly rule with only his personal charisma and his fighting skills.

As of 2006, systems can scan number plates at around one per second on cars travelling up to 100 mph (160 km/h). They can use existing  closed-circuit television or  road-rule enforcement cameras, or ones specifically designed for the task. They are used by various police forces and as a method of  electronic toll collection on  pay-per-use roads, and monitoring traffic activity such as red light adherence in an intersection.ANPR can be used to store the images captured by the cameras as well as the text from the licence plate, with some configurable to store a photograph of the driver. Systems commonly use  infrared lighting to allow the camera to take the picture at any time of day. A powerful flash is included in at least one version of the intersection-monitoring cameras, serving to both illuminate the picture and make the offender aware of his or her mistake. ANPR technology tends to be region specific, owing to plate variation from place to place.The  software aspect of the system runs on standard PC hardware and can be linked to other applications or  databases. It first uses a series of image manipulation techniques to detect, normalise and enhance the image of the number plate, and finally optical character recognition (OCR) to extract the  alphanumerics of the licence plate. ANPR/ALPR systems are generally deployed in one of two basic approaches; one allows for the entire process to be performed at the lane location in real-time, the other transmits all the images from many lanes to a remote computer location and performs the OCR process there at some later point in time. When done at the lane site, the information captured of the plate alphanumeric, date-time, lane identification, and any other information that is required is completed in somewhere around 250 milliseconds. This information, now small data packets, can easily be transmitted to some remote computer for further processing if necessary, or stored at the lane for later retrieval. In the other arrangement there are typically large numbers of PCs used in a  server farm to handle high workloads, such as those found in the  London congestion charge project. Often in such systems there is a requirement to forward images to the remote server and this can require larger bandwidth transmission mediums.Concerns about these systems have centered on privacy fears of government tracking citizens' movements and media reports of misidentification and high error rates.

When viewed with proper convergence, the repeating patterns appear to float in the air above the background. The  Magic Eye series of books features another type of autostereogram called a  random dot autostereogram. In this type of autostereogram, every  pixel in the image is computed from a pattern strip and a depth map. Usually, a hidden 3D scene emerges when the image is viewed with proper viewing technique.There are two ways an autostereogram can be viewed: wall-eyed and cross-eyed. Most autostereograms are designed to be viewed in only one way, which is usually wall-eyed. Wall-eyed viewing requires that the two eyes adopt a relatively  divergent angle, while cross-eyed viewing requires a relatively  convergent angle.',\n",

Together with neighbouring Koryaksky volcano, it has been designated a  Decade Volcano, worthy of particular study in light of its history of explosive eruptions and proximity to populated areas.',\n",
       " 'Avalanche': 'An avalanche is a very large slide of snow (or rock) down a mountainside, caused when a buildup of snow is released down a slope, and is one of the major dangers faced in the  mountains. An avalanche consists of rapidly moving  granular material that has exceeded the critical  static friction threshold and thereby causes additional material to exceed its threshold as well, in a cascading effect.In an avalanche, large quantities of material (or mixtures of different types of material) fall or slide rapidly under the force of gravity. Avalanches are often classified by what they are made of, for example snow, ice,  rock or soil avalanches. A mixture of these would be called a debris avalanche.A large avalanche can run for many miles, and can create massive destruction of the lower forest and anything else in its path. For example, in  Montroc, France, in 1999, 300,000 cubic metres of snow slid on a 30 degree slope, achieving a speed of 100 km/h (60 mph). It killed 12 people in their chalets under 100,000 tons of snow, 5 meters (15 feet) deep. The Mayor of  Chamonix was convicted of second-degree murder for not evacuating the area, but received a suspended sentence.During World War I, approximately 50,000 soldiers died as a result of avalanches during the mountain campaign in the Alps at the Austrian-Italian front, many of which were caused by artillery fire.  However, it is very doubtful avalanches were used deliberately at the strategic level as weapons; more likely they were simply a side effect to shelling enemy troops, occasionally adding to the toll taken by the artillery. Avalanche prediction is difficult even with detailed weather reports and core samples from the snowpack. It would be almost impossible to predict avalanche conditions many miles behind enemy lines, making it impossible to intentionally target a slope at risk for avalanches. Also, high priority targets received continual shelling and would be unable to build up enough unstable snow to form devastating avalanches, effectively imitating the avalanche prevention programs at ski resorts.',\n",

Axes made of copper,  bronze, iron and steel appeared as these technologies developed.The axe is an example of a  simple machine, as it is a type of  wedge, or dual  inclined plane. This reduces the effort needed by the wood chopper. It spilts the wood into two parts by the pression.Most modern axes have steel heads and wooden handles (typically  hickory) although  plastic or fibreglass handles are not uncommon. Modern axes are specialized by use, size and form. Hafted axes with short handles designed for use with one hand are often called hand axes but the term hand axe refers to axes without handles as well.

       " 'Barbara_McClintock': \"Barbara McClintock ( June 16,  1902 –  September 2,  1992) was a pioneering American scientist and one of the world's most distinguished  cytogeneticists. McClintock received her  PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927, where she was a leader in the development of maize cytogenetics. The field remained the focus of her research for the rest of her career. From the late  1920s, McClintock studied  chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. Her work was groundbreaking: she developed the technique to visualize maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas, including  genetic recombination by  crossing-over during  meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first  genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome with physical traits, and she demonstrated the role of the  telomere and  centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized amongst the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships and elected a member of the  National Academy of Sciences in 1944.During the  1940s and  1950s, McClintock discovered  transposition and used it to show how  genes are responsible for turning physical characteristics on or off. She developed theories to explain the repression or expression of genetic information from one generation of maize plants to the next. Encountering skepticism of her research and its implications, she stopped publishing her data in 1953. Later, she made an extensive study of the cytogenetics and  ethnobotany of maize  races from South America. McClintock's research became well understood in the 1960s and 1970s, as researchers demonstrated the mechanisms of genetic change and  genetic regulation that she had demonstrated in her maize research in the 1940s and 1950s. Awards and recognition of her contributions to the field followed, including the  Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded to her in 1983 for the discovery of genetic  transposition; to date, she has been the first and only woman to receive an unshared Nobel Prize in that category.\",\n",

Besides humans, they are the only  primates that live freely in Europe. Although the species is commonly referred to as the \"Barbary Ape\", the Barbary Macaque is a true monkey, not an ape.It is yellowish-brown to grey with lighter undersides, growing to a maximum size of 75 cm (30 in) and 13 kg (29 lb). Its face is a dark pink and its tail is  vestigial. The front limbs of this monkey are longer than its hind limbs. Females are somewhat smaller than males.Dwelling in forests of  cedar,  pine and  oak, the Barbary Macaque may frequent elevations of 2,100 m (6,900 ft) or more. It is a  diurnal animal, dividing its time more or less equally between  arboreal and terrestrial territory. Mostly herbivorous, this monkey feeds on leaves, roots, and fruit, but will also eat  insects. By day, the Barbary Macaque patrols a territory which may span several square kilometers; it peacefully co-exists with other primate species, sharing watering holes without incident. The Barbary Macaque moves about energetically on all fours, occasionally rising erect on its hind limbs to survey for threats.The Barbary Macaque is a gregarious monkey, forming mixed groups of several females and males; the troop of 10 to 30 individuals is matriarchal, with its hierarchy determined by lineage to the lead female. Unlike other macaques, the males participate in rearing the young; much time is spent playing and grooming with them. In this way, a strong social bond is formed between a male and his offspring, both the male\\'s own and those of others in the troop.

The Baroque style used exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to produce drama, tension, exuberance, and grandeur in sculpture, painting, literature, and music. The style started around 1600 in Rome, Italy and spread to most of Europe. In music, the Baroque applies to the final period of dominance of imitative  counterpoint, where different voices and instruments echo each other but at different pitches, sometimes inverting the echo, and even reversing thematic material.The popularity and success of the \"Baroque\" was encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church which had decided at the time of the  Council of Trent that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvement. The aristocracy also saw the dramatic style of Baroque architecture and art as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumphant power and control. Baroque palaces are built around an entrance sequence of courts, anterooms, grand staircases, and reception rooms of sequentially increasing magnificence. In similar profusions of detail, art, music, architecture, and literature inspired each other in the \"Baroque\"  cultural movement as artists explored what they could create from repeated and varied patterns.The word baroque derives from the ancient Portuguese  noun \"barroco\" which is a pearl that is not round but of unpredictable and elaborate shape. Hence, in informal usage, the word baroque can simply mean that something is \"elaborate\", with many details, without reference to the Baroque styles of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.',\n",

The batter attempts to hit the baseball with a tapered cylindrical  bat, made of wood (as required in  professional baseball) or a variety of other materials (as allowed in many nonprofessional games). A team scores  runs only when batting, by advancing its players—primarily via  hits—counterclockwise past a series of four markers called  bases arranged at the corners of a ninety-foot square, or \"diamond.\" The game, played without time restriction, is structured around nine segments called  innings.

Basil is originally native to India and other tropical regions of Asia, having been cultivated there for more than 5,000 years. It is prominently featured in varied cuisines throughout the world including Italian, Thai, Vietnamese and Laotian. It grows to between 20–60 cm tall, with opposite, light green, silky  leaves 1.5–5 cm long and 1–3 cm broad. The flowers are quite big, white in colour and arranged in a terminal  spike. Unusual among  Lamiaceae, the four  stamens and the  pistil are not pushed under the upper lip of the  corolla, but lay over the inferior. After  entomophilous pollination, the corolla falls off and four round  achenes develop inside the bilabiate  calyx. The plant tastes somewhat like  anise, with a strong, pungent, sweet smell. Basil is very sensitive to cold, with best growth in hot, dry conditions. While most common varieties are treated as  annuals, some are  perennial, including African Blue and Holy Thai basil.The word basil comes from the  Greek βασιλεύς (basileus), meaning \"king\", as it is believed to have grown above the spot where St. Constantine and Helen discovered the Holy Cross. The  Oxford English Dictionary quotes speculations that basil may have been used in \"some royal unguent, bath, or medicine\". Basil is still considered the \"king of herbs\" by many cookery authors.

Other research places the genus as an outgroup which is not very closely related to foxes. The Bat-eared Fox is an old species, that was widely distributed in the  Pleistocene era. In that time it even lived in parts of West and South Asia. Retrieved from \" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat-eared_Fox\"',\n",

       " 'Bath_School_disaster': \"The Bath School disaster was a series of  bombings in  Bath Township,  Michigan, USA, on  May 18,  1927, which killed 45 people and injured 58. Most of the victims were children in second to sixth  grades attending the Bath Consolidated School. The bombings constituted the deadliest act of  mass murder in a school in U.S. history, claiming more than three times as many victims as the Columbine High School massacre.The perpetrator was  school board member Andrew Kehoe, who was upset by a  property tax that had been levied to fund the construction of the school building. He blamed the additional tax for financial hardships which led to  foreclosure proceedings against his farm. These events apparently provoked Kehoe to plan his attack.On the morning of  May 18, Kehoe first killed his wife and then set his farm buildings on fire. As fire fighters arrived at the farm, an explosion devastated the north wing of the school building, killing many of the people inside. Kehoe used a detonator to ignite  dynamite and hundreds of  pounds of  pyrotol which he had secretly planted inside the school over the course of many months. As rescuers started gathering at the school, Kehoe drove up, stopped, and detonated a bomb inside his  shrapnel-filled vehicle, killing himself and the  school superintendent and killing and injuring several others. During the rescue efforts, searchers discovered an additional 500 pounds (230  kg) of unexploded dynamite and pyrotol planted throughout the  basement of the school's south wing.\",\n",
       " 'Batholith': 'A batholith (from Greek bathos, depth + lithos, rock) is a large emplacement of  igneous  intrusive (also called plutonic) rock that forms from cooled magma deep in the Earth\\'s crust. Batholiths are almost always made mostly of  felsic or intermediate rock-types, such as granite,  quartz monzonite, or  diorite (see also  granite dome).Although they may appear uniform, batholiths are in fact structures with complex histories and compositions. They are composed of multiple masses, or plutons, bodies of igneous rock of irregular dimensions (typically at least several kilometers) that can be distinguished from adjacent igneous rock by some combination of criteria including age, composition, texture, or mappable structures. Individual plutons are crystallized from magma that traveled toward the surface from a zone of partial melting near the base of the Earth\\'s crust.Traditionally, these plutons have been considered to form by ascent of relatively  buoyant magma in large masses called plutonic  diapirs. Because the diapirs are liquefied and very hot, they tend to rise through the surrounding  country rock, pushing it aside and partially melting it. Most diapirs do not reach the surface to form volcanoes, but instead slow down, cool and usually solidify 5 to 30 kilometers underground as plutons (hence the use of the word pluton; in reference to the Roman god of the underworld  Pluto). It has also been proposed that plutons commonly are formed not by diapiric ascent of large magma diapirs, but rather by aggregation of smaller volumes of magma that ascended as dikes.A batholith is formed when many plutons converge together to form a huge expanse of granitic rock. Some batholiths are mammoth, paralleling past and present  subduction zones and other heat sources for hundreds of kilometers in continental crust. One such batholith is the  Sierra Nevada Batholith, which is a continuous granitic formation that forms much of the  Sierra Nevada in California. An even larger batholith, found predominantly in the  Coast Mountains of western Canada, extends for 1,800 kilometers and reaches into southeastern  Alaska.There is also an important geographic usage of the term batholith. For a geographer, a batholith is an exposed area of mostly continuous plutonic rock that covers an area larger than 100 square kilometers. Areas smaller than 100 kilometers are called stocks. However, the majority of batholiths visible at the surface (via outcroppings) have areas far greater than 100 square kilometers. These areas are exposed to the surface through the process of  erosion accelerated by  continental uplift acting over many tens of millions to hundreds of millions of years. This process has removed several tens of kilometers of overlying rock in many areas, exposing the once deeply buried batholiths.Batholiths exposed at the surface are also subjected to huge pressure differences between their former homes deep in the earth and their new homes at or near the surface. As a result, their  crystal structure expands slightly and over time. This manifests itself by a form of  mass wasting called  exfoliation. This form of erosion causes convex and relatively thin sheets of rock to slough off the exposed surfaces of batholiths (a process accelerated by  frost wedging). The result is fairly clean and rounded rock faces. A famous example of the result of this process is  Half Dome, which located in the world-famous  Yosemite Valley (see picture).

Allied forces advanced over seven  miles on the first day, one of the greatest advances of the war. The battle is also notable for its effects on both sides\\'  morale and the large amount of  surrendering  German forces. This led  Erich Ludendorff to famously describe the first day of the battle as \"the black day of the German Army.\" Amiens was one of the first major battles involving  armoured warfare and marked the end of trench warfare on the  Western Front, fighting becoming mobile once again until  the armistice was signed on  November 11th,  1918.',\n",

It was fought on  December 2,  1805 about four  miles (6.4\\xa0 km) east of the modern Czech town of  Brno, then part of the  Austrian Empire. The conflict involved forces of the recently formed  First French Empire against the armies of the  Russian Empire and the Austrian Empire. After nearly nine hours of fighting, the French troops, commanded by  Emperor Napoleon\\xa0I, managed to score a decisive victory over the Russo-Austrian army, commanded by  Czar Alexander\\xa0I. Despite difficult fighting in many sectors, the battle is often regarded as a tactical masterpiece.Austerlitz effectively brought the Third Coalition to an end. On  December 26,  1805, Austria and France signed the  Treaty of Pressburg, which took the former out of the war, reinforced the earlier treaties of  Campo Formio and  Lunéville, made Austria cede land to Napoleon's German allies, and imposed an  indemnity of 40 million  francs on the defeated  Habsburgs. Russian troops were allowed to head back to home soil. Victory at Austerlitz also permitted the creation of the  Confederation of the Rhine, a collection of German states intended as a buffer zone between France and the rest of Europe. In 1806, the Holy Roman Empire ceased to exist when  Holy Roman Emperor  Francis\\xa0II kept  Francis\\xa0I of Austria as his only official title. These achievements, however, did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. After Austerlitz,  Prussian worries about growing French influence in  Central Europe sparked the  War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806.\",\n",

The battle has been passed down in  Islamic history as a decisive victory attributable to  divine intervention or the genius of Muhammad. Although it is one of the few battles specifically mentioned in the Muslim holy book, the Qur'ān, virtually all contemporary knowledge of the battle at  Badr comes from traditional Islamic accounts, both  hadiths and biographies of Muhammad, written decades after the battle.Prior to the battle, the Muslims and Meccans had been engaging in several smaller  skirmishes and by late 623 and early 624 the Muslim  ghazawāt had become more frequent. Badr, however was the first large-scale engagement between the two forces. Muhammad was leading a raiding party against a Quraish  caravan when he was surprised by a much larger Quraishi army, however some  Islamic scholars have questioned raiding the caravan, both opinions are discussed in the article. Advancing to a strong  defensive position, Muhammad's well-disciplined men managed to shatter the Meccan lines, killing several important Quraishi leaders including Muhammad's chief antagonist,  'Amr ibn Hishām. For the early Muslims the battle was extremely significant because it was the first sign that they might eventually overcome their persecutors in Mecca. Mecca at this time was one of the richest and most powerful  pagan cities in Arabia, fielding an army three times larger than that of the Muslims.\",\n",

A combined French and  Venetian force under  Odet de Foix, Vicomte de Lautrec, was decisively defeated by an Imperial, Spanish, and  Papal army under the overall command of  Prospero Colonna. Lautrec then withdrew from  Lombardy, leaving the  Duchy of Milan in Imperial hands.Having been driven from Milan by an Imperial advance in late 1521, Lautrec had regrouped, attempting to strike at Colonna's lines of communication. When the  Swiss mercenaries in French service did not receive their pay, however, they demanded an immediate battle, and Lautrec was forced to attack Colonna's fortified position in the park of Bicocca, north of Milan. The Swiss pikemen advanced over open fields under heavy artillery fire to assault the Imperial positions, but were halted at a sunken road backed by earthworks. Having suffered massive casualties from the fire of Spanish  arquebusiers, the Swiss retreated. Meanwhile, an attempt by French cavalry to flank Colonna's position proved equally ineffective. The Swiss, unwilling to fight further, marched off to their  cantons a few days later, and Lautrec retreated into Venetian territory with the remnants of his army.The battle is noted chiefly for marking the end of the Swiss dominance among the infantry of the  Italian Wars, and of the Swiss method of assaults by massed columns of pikemen without support from other troops. It was simultaneously the first of a series of engagements which established the decisive role of  firearms on the battlefield.\",\n",
       " 'Battle_of_Britain': \"One of the major campaigns of the early part of World War II, the Battle of Britain is the name commonly given to the attempt by the German Luftwaffe to gain  air superiority over the Royal Air Force (RAF), before a planned sea and  airborne invasion of  Britain ( Operation Sealion). Neither Hitler nor the German  Wehrmacht believed it possible to carry out a successful  amphibious assault on the British Isles until the Royal Air Force had been neutralised. Secondary objectives were to destroy aircraft production and ground infrastructure, as well as terrorising the British people with the intent of intimidating them into seeking an  armistice or surrender and attacking areas of political interest.British historians regard the battle as running from  9 July to  31 October  1940, which represented the most intense period of daylight  air raiding. German historians begin the battle in mid-August 1940 and end it in May 1941, on the withdrawal of the  bomber units in preparation for the  attack on the USSR. The failure of Nazi Germany to destroy Britain's air forces to allow for an invasion or to break the spirit of either the British government or people is widely considered the  Third Reich's first major defeat.Some historians have argued that no invasion could have succeeded given the massive superiority of the Royal Navy over the  Kriegsmarine; Sealion would have been a disaster. They argue that the Luftwaffe would have been unable to prevent decisive intervention by RN cruisers and destroyers, even with air superiority. An Italian  expeditionary force called  Corpo Aereo Italiano also took part in the latter stages of battle on the German side. The Battle of Britain was the first major battle to be fought entirely in the air. It was the largest and most sustained bombing campaign yet attempted and the first real test of the  strategic bombing theories that had emerged since the previous World War.\",\n",
       " 'Battle_of_Cannae': \"The Battle of Cannae was a major battle of the  Second Punic War, taking place on  August 2,  216 BC near the town of  Cannae in  Apulia in southeast Italy. The  Carthaginian army under  Hannibal destroyed a numerically superior  Roman army under command of the  consuls  Lucius Aemilius Paullus and  Gaius Terentius Varro. Following the Battle of Cannae,  Capua and several other Italian city-states defected from the Roman Republic. Although the battle failed to decide the outcome of the war in favour of Carthage, it is today regarded as one of the greatest  tactical feats in  military history.Having recovered from their previous losses at  Trebia ( 218 BC) and  Trasimene ( 217 BC), the Romans decided to confront Hannibal at Cannae, with roughly 87,000 Roman and Allied troops. With their right wing positioned near the  Aufidus river, the Romans placed their cavalry on their flanks and massed their heavy infantry in an exceptionally deep formation in the centre. To counter this, Hannibal utilized the  double-envelopment tactic. He drew up his least reliable infantry in the centre, with the flanks composed of Carthaginian cavalry. Before engaging the Romans, however, his lines adopted a crescent shape — advancing his centre with his veteran troops placed at the wings in  echelon formation. Upon the onset of the battle, the Carthaginian centre withdrew before the advance of the numerically superior Romans. While Hannibal's centre line yielded, the Romans had unknowingly driven themselves into a large arc — whereupon the Carthaginian infantry and cavalry (positioned on the flanks)  encircled the main body of Roman infantry. Surrounded and attacked on all sides with no means of escape, the Roman army was subsequently cut to pieces. An estimated 60,000–70,000 Romans were killed or captured at Cannae (including the consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus and eighty  Roman senators). In terms of the number of lives lost within a single day, Cannae is among the  costliest battles in all of recorded human history.\",\n",

Union  Major General  George G. Meade's  Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by  Confederate General  Robert E. Lee's  Army of Northern Virginia, ending Lee's invasion of the  North.Following his brilliant success at  Chancellorsville in May 1863, Lee led his army through the  Shenandoah Valley for his second invasion of the North, hoping to reach as far as  Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or even  Philadelphia, and to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war. Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln, Maj. Gen.  Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit, but was relieved almost on the eve of battle and replaced by Meade.The two armies began to collide at Gettysburg on  July 1,  1863, as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there. Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division, which was soon reinforced with two  corps of Union infantry. However, two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north, collapsing the hastily developed Union lines, sending the defenders retreating through the streets of town to the hills just to the south.On the second day of battle, most of both armies had assembled. The Union line was laid out resembling a fishhook. Lee launched a heavy assault on the Union left flank and fierce fighting raged at  Little Round Top, the  Wheatfield,  Devil's Den, and the  Peach Orchard. On the Union right, demonstrations escalated into full-scale assaults on  Culp's Hill and  Cemetery Hill. Across the battlefield, despite significant losses, the Union defenders held their lines.On the third day of battle,  July 3, fighting resumed on Culp's Hill and cavalry battles raged to the east and south, but the main event was a dramatic infantry assault by 12,500 Confederates against the centre of the Union line on  Cemetery Ridge.  Pickett's Charge was repulsed by Union rifle and artillery fire at great losses to the Confederate army. Lee led his army on a torturous retreat back to Virginia. Between 46,000 and 51,000 Americans were casualties in the three-day battle. That November President Lincoln used the dedication ceremony for the  Gettysburg National Cemetery to honour the Union dead and redefine the purpose of the war in his historic Gettysburg Address.\",\n",

       " 'Battle_of_Hastings': 'The Battle of Hastings was the most decisive  Norman victory in the Norman conquest of England. On  October 14,  1066, the Normans of  Duke William of Normandy (aka \"Guillaume Le Conquérant\" in  Norman, \"William the Conqueror\" in English) defeated the  English army led by  King  Harold II. Harold had claimed the throne of England for himself in January of that year soon after Edward the Confessor died, ignoring William\\'s earlier claims. The resulting  Norman Invasion of England remains the last time England has been conquered by a foreign power.On  September 28,  1066, William of Normandy, asserting by arms his claim to the English crown, landed unopposed at  Pevensey after being delayed by a storm in the English Channel. Legend has it that upon setting foot on the beach, William tripped and fell on his face. Turning potential embarrassment in front of his troops into a  face-saving exercise, he rose with his hands full of sand and shouted \"I now take hold of the land of England!\" This bears suspicious resemblance to the story of Julius Caesar\\'s invasion of Britain; and was probably employed by William\\'s biographer to enhance the similarities between Caesar and William.On hearing the news of the landing of the Duke\\'s forces, the English Harold II, who had just destroyed an invading Norwegian army under King  Harald Hardråda and  Tostig Godwinson (Harold\\'s brother) at the  Battle of Stamford Bridge, hurried southward from London the morning of the 12th, gathering what forces he could on the way. He arrived at the battlefield the night of  13 October  1066.Harold deployed his force, astride the road from  Hastings to London, on  Senlac Hill some six miles inland from Hastings. To his back was the great forest of Anderida ( the Weald) and in front the ground fell away in a long  glacis-like slope, which at the bottom rose again as the opposing slope of  Telham Hill. The later town called  Battle in the modern county of  East Sussex was named to commemorate this event.The English force is usually estimated at seven to eight thousand strong, and consisted entirely of  infantry (the English rode to their battles but did not fight from horseback). It comprised the English men-at-arms of the  fyrd, mainly  thegns (the English equivalent of a land-holding aristocracy), along with a substantial amount of local peasant levies, lesser thegns, and a core of professional warriors:  Housecarls, the King\\'s royal troops and bodyguards. The thegns and housecarls, probably veterans of the recent  Stamford Bridge battle, were armed principally with swords, spears, and in some cases the formidable  Danish axes, and were protected by coats of  chainmail and their  shields. They took the front ranks, forming a \\' shield wall\\' with interlocking shields side by side. Behind the thegns and housecarls, the lesser thegns and peasant levies were armed with whatever weapons they had at hand. The entire army took up position along the ridgeline; as casualties fell in the front lines the lesser thegns and peasants would move forward to fill the gaps. The English, however, were still exhausted from the  Battle of Stamford Bridge, where they had achieved an almost- Pyrrhic victory against the Vikings, and were in no shape to fight again.On the morning of Saturday,  14 October  1066, Duke William of Normandy gathered his army below the English position. The Norman army was of comparable size to the English force, and composed of William\\'s  Norman,  Breton and  Flemish  vassals along with their retainers, and freebooters from as far away as Norman Italy. The nobles had been promised English lands and titles in return for their material support: the common troopers were paid with the spoils and \"cash\", and hoped for land when English fiefs were handed out. Many had also come because they considered it a holy  crusade, due to the Pope\\'s decision to bless the invasion. The army was deployed in the classic medieval fashion of three divisions, or \"battles\" - the Normans taking the centre, the Bretons on the left wing and the Franco-Flemish on right wing. Each  battle comprised infantry, cavalry and  archers along with crossbowmen. The archers and crossbowmen stood to the front for the start of the battle.Legend has it that William\\'s minstrel and knight,  Ivo Taillefer, begged his master for permission to strike the first blows of the battle. Permission was granted, and Taillefer rode before the English alone, tossing his sword and lance in the air and catching them while he sang an early version of  The Song of Roland. The earliest account of this tale (in  The Carmen de Hastingae Proelio) says that an English champion came from the ranks, and Taillefer quickly slew him, taking his head as a trophy to show that God favoured the invaders: later 12th century sources say that Taillefer charged into the English ranks and killed one to three Englishmen before suffering death himself. Regardless, fighting was now underway.',\n",

It was fought on  May 31– June 1,  1916, in the North Sea near  Jutland, the mainland of Denmark. The combatants were the  Kaiserliche Marine’s  High Seas Fleet commanded by  Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer and the Royal Navy’s  Grand Fleet commanded by  Admiral of the Fleet Sir John Jellicoe. The intention of the German fleet was to break the British naval blockade of the North Sea and allow German mercantile shipping to operate again.The Germans plan was to use  Vice Admiral Franz Hipper’s scouting group of five modern battlecruisers to lure  Vice Admiral Sir David Beatty’s  battlecruiser squadrons into the path of the main German battle  fleet and so destroy them. But the British had learned from signal intercepts (the British had been given a German codebook from the light cruiser  SMS Magdeburg, boarded by Russian naval officers after the ship ran aground in Russian territorial waters) that a major fleet operation was likely, and on  30 May Jellicoe sailed with the Grand Fleet to rendezvous with Beatty.On the afternoon of  31 May, Beatty and Hipper encountered each other, and in a running battle to the south Hipper drew the British into the path of the High Seas Fleet. Beatty turned and fled towards the Grand Fleet and from 18:30 until nightfall at about 20:30 the two huge fleets — totaling 250 ships between them — were heavily engaged. Fourteen British and eleven German ships were sunk with great loss of life. Jellicoe tried to cut the Germans off from their base in the hope of continuing the battle in the morning, but under cover of darkness Scheer crossed the wake of the British fleet and returned to port.Both sides claimed victory. The British had lost more ships and many more sailors, but Scheer’s plan of destroying Beatty’s squadrons had failed. The Germans continued to pose a threat that required the British to keep their battleships concentrated in the North Sea, but they never again contested control of the seas. Instead, the German Navy turned its efforts and resources to  unrestricted submarine warfare.',\n",

He decided to ambush it with his force of spear throwers, or  peltasts. By launching repeated hit-and-run attacks against the Spartan formation, Iphicrates and his men were able to wear the Spartans down, eventually routing them and killing just under half.

Although successful, most of this force perished in a storm off  Mount Athos, and the remainder was forced to return to Asia, losing men along the way. In  490 BC,  Datis and  Artaphernes were sent in a maritime operation to subjugate the  Cyclades islands in the central  Aegean and punish  Eretria and Athens for their assistance in the Ionian revolt. Eretria was besieged and fell; then the fleet landed in Marathon bay. There they were defeated by a small force of Athenian and  Plataean  hoplites, despite their numerical advantage.

       " 'Battle_of_Midway': \"The Battle of Midway was a pivotal  naval battle in the  Pacific Theatre of World War II. It took place from  June 4 to  June 7,  1942, approximately one month after the  Battle of the Coral Sea, and six months after the  Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbour that had led to a state of war between the United States of America and Japan. During the battle, the  United States Navy defeated a Japanese attack against Midway Atoll (located northwest of  Hawai’i) and destroyed four Japanese aircraft carriers and a  heavy cruiser while losing a carrier and a  destroyer.The battle was a crushing defeat for the Japanese and is widely regarded as the most important naval battle of World War II. The battle permanently weakened the Japanese Navy, particularly the loss of over 200 naval aviators. Strategically, the U.S. Navy was able to seize the initiative in the Pacific and go on the offensive.The Japanese plan of attack, which included a secondary attack against the  Aleutian Islands by a smaller fleet, was an attempt by the Japanese to lure America's few remaining carriers into a trap and sink them. The Japanese also intended to occupy Midway Atoll to extend Japan's defensive perimeter further from its home islands. This operation was considered preparatory for further attacks against Fiji and Samoa, as well as the invasion of Hawai’i.Had the Japanese captured Midway, the northeastern  Pacific Rim would have been essentially defenseless. Success also would have removed the last capital ships in the  U.S. Pacific Fleet, ensuring Japanese naval supremacy in the Pacific until perhaps late 1943. Thus, the Midway operation, like the attack on Pearl Harbour that had plunged the United States into war, was not part of a campaign for the conquest of the United States itself, but was aimed at its elimination as a strategic Pacific power, thereby giving Japan a free hand in establishing its  Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It was also hoped that another defeat would force the Americans to the negotiating table to terminate the Pacific War.\",\n",
       " 'Battle_of_Moscow': \"The Battle of Moscow (Russian: Битва за Москву, Bitva za Moskvu) refers to the  Soviet defense of Moscow and the subsequent Soviet  counter-offensive that occurred between October 1941 and January 1942 on the  Eastern Front of World War II against German forces. Adolf Hitler considered Moscow, which was the capital of the  Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR) and the largest Soviet city, to be the primary military and political objective for the Axis forces in their  invasion of the Soviet Union. A separate German plan was codenamed  Operation Wotan.The original blitzkrieg invasion plan, which the Axis called  Operation Barbarossa, had called for the capture of Moscow within three to four months. However, despite large initial advances, the  Wehrmacht was soon slowed by Soviet resistance (in particular during the  Battle of Smolensk, which lasted from July through September 1941 and delayed the German offensive towards Moscow for two months). Having secured  Smolensk, the Wehrmacht was forced to consolidate its lines around Leningrad and Kiev, further delaying the drive towards Moscow. The  Axis advance was finally renewed on  September 30,  1941, with an offensive codenamed Operation Typhoon, the goal of which was the capture of Moscow before the onset of winter.After a successful initial advance leading to the encirclement and destruction of several  Soviet armies, the German offensive was stopped by Soviet resistance at the  Mozhaisk defensive line, just 120\\xa0km (75\\xa0mi) from the capital. Having penetrated the Soviet defenses, the Wehrmacht offensive was slowed by weather conditions, with autumn rains turning roads and fields into thick mud that significantly impeded Axis vehicles, horses, and soldiers. Although the onset of colder weather and the freezing of the ground allowed the Axis advance to continue, it continued to struggle in the face of the severe cold and stiffening Soviet resistance.By early December, the lead German  Panzer Groups stood less than 30\\xa0kilometers (19\\xa0mi) from the  Kremlin, and Wehrmacht officers were able to see some of Moscow's buildings with binoculars; but, handicapped by cold and exhausted troops, the Axis forces were unable to make further advances. On  December 5,  1941, fresh Soviet  Siberian troops, prepared for  winter warfare, attacked the German forces in front of Moscow; by January 1942, the Wehrmacht had been driven back 100 to 250\\xa0km (60 to 150\\xa0mi), ending the immediate threat to Moscow and marking the closest that Axis forces ever got to capturing the Soviet capital.The Battle of Moscow is usually considered one of the most important battles in the war between the Axis Powers and the USSR, primarily because the Soviets were able to successfully prevent the most serious attempt to capture their capital. The battle was also one of the largest during World War II, with more than a million total casualties. It marked a turning point as it was the first time since the  Wehrmacht began its conquests in 1939 war that it had been forced into a major retreat. The Wehrmacht had been forced to retreat earlier during the  Yelnya Offensive in September 1941 and at the  Battle of Rostov (1941) (which led to von Rundstedt losing his job), but these retreats were minor compared to the one at Moscow.\",\n",

Over sixty years later, the  Normandy invasion,  codenamed Operation Overlord, still remains the largest seaborne invasion in history, involving almost three million troops crossing the English Channel from England to  Normandy in then German-occupied France.The primary Allied formations that saw combat in Normandy came from the United States of America, United Kingdom and Canada. Substantial  Free French and Polish forces also participated in the battle after the assault phase, and there were also contingents from Belgium,  Czechoslovakia, Greece,  the Netherlands, and Norway.The Normandy invasion began with overnight  parachute and  glider landings, massive  air attacks and  naval bombardments, and an early morning  amphibious assault on  June 6, “ D-Day”. The battle for Normandy continued for more than two months, with campaigns to establish, expand, and eventually break out of the Allied beachheads, and concluded with the  liberation of Paris and the fall of the  Falaise pocket in late August 1944.The battle of Normandy was described thus by Adolf Hitler\\xa0: “In the East, the vastness of space will… permit a loss of territory… without suffering a mortal blow to Germany’s chance for survival. Not so in the West! If the enemy here succeeds… consequences of staggering proportions will follow within a short time.”',\n",

The battle took place in the  South Pacific between  Rennell Island and  Guadalcanal in the southern Solomon Islands.In the battle, Japanese naval land-based  torpedo  bombers, seeking to provide protection for the impending evacuation of Japanese forces from Guadalcanal, made several attacks over two days on United States' (U.S.)  warships operating as a  task force south of Guadalcanal. In addition to approaching Guadalcanal with the objective of engaging any Japanese ships that might come into range, the U.S. task force was protecting an  Allied transport ship convoy that was carrying replacement  troops to Guadalcanal. As a result of the Japanese air attacks on the task force, one U.S.  heavy cruiser was sunk, a  destroyer was heavily damaged, and the rest of the U.S. task force was forced to retreat from the southern Solomons area. Due, in part, to their success in turning back the U.S. task force in this battle, the Japanese were successful in evacuating their remaining troops from Guadalcanal by February 7, 1943, leaving Guadalcanal in Allied hands and ending the battle for the island.\",\n",

The primary combatant groups were the native  Tlingits of Sheet’-ká X\\'áat\\'l ( Baranof Island) and agents of the  Russian-American Company. Though the Russians\\' initial assault (in which  Alexandr Baranov, head of the Russian expedition, sustained serious injuries) was repelled, their naval escorts bombarded the Tlingit fort Shis\\'kí Noow mercilessly, driving the natives into the surrounding forest after only a few days. The Russian victory was decisive, and resulted in the Tlingit being permanently displaced from their ancestral lands. The Tlingit fled north and established a new settlement on the neighboring  Chichagof Island.Animosity between the two cultures, though greatly diminished, continued in the form of sporadic attacks by the natives against the Russian settlement as late as 1858.

Staged almost simultaneously with the  Battle of the Dnieper, the offensive lasted 2 months and was led by Generals  Andrei Yeremenko and  Vasily Sokolovsky. It was aimed at clearing the German presence from the  Smolensk and  Bryansk regions. Smolensk had been under German occupation since the first  Battle of Smolensk in 1941.Despite an impressive German defense, the Red Army was able to stage several breakthroughs, liberating several major cities including Smolensk and  Roslavl. They moved into occupied  Belorussia. However, the overall advance was quite modest and slow in the face of heavy German resistance, and the operation was therefore accomplished in three stages: August 7–20, August 21–September 6, and September 7–October 2.Although playing a major military role in its own right, the Smolensk Operation was also important for its effect on the Battle of the Dnieper. It has been estimated that as many as fifty-five German divisions were committed to counter the Smolensk Operation — divisions which would have been critical to prevent Soviet troops from crossing the  Dnieper in the south. In the course of the operation the Red Army also definitively drove back German forces from the Smolensk land bridge, historically the most important approach for a western attack on Moscow.',\n",
       " 'Battle_of_Stalingrad': \"The Battle of Stalingrad was the most important turning point of World War II and is considered  the bloodiest battle in human history, with more combined casualties suffered than any battle before or since. The battle was marked by brutality and disregard for military and  civilian casualties on both sides. The battle is taken to include the German siege of the southern Russian city of  Stalingrad (now  Volgograd), the battle inside the city, and the Soviet counter-offensive which eventually trapped and destroyed the  German Sixth Army and other  Axis forces around the city. Total casualties for both sides are estimated to be over two million. As a result of the battle, the Axis powers suffered roughly 850,000 casualties, 1/4 of their strength on the Eastern Front, as well as a huge amount of supplies and equipment. The Axis forces were never able to recover from this loss and were eventually forced into a long retreat out of  Eastern Europe. For the Soviets, who also suffered great losses during the battle, the victory at Stalingrad marked the start of the  liberation of the Soviet Union leading to eventual victory over Nazi Germany in  1945.Besides being a turning point in the war, Stalingrad was also revealing in terms of the discipline and determination of both the German and Soviet armies. The Soviets first defended Stalingrad against a fierce German onslaught. So great were Soviet losses that at points in time the life expectancy of a newly arrived soldier was less than a day, yet discipline was maintained and soldiers gave their lives rather than retreat. Their sacrifice is immortalized by a soldier of General Rodimstev about to die who scratched on the wall of the tractor factory 'Rodimstev's Guardsmen fought and died here for their motherland (rodina)'. Next, after being surrounded, the German Army showed remarkable discipline. It was the first time that it had operated under adverse conditions of such scale. Short of food and clothing, during the latter part of the siege many German soldiers literally starved or froze to death. Yet, discipline and obedience to authority prevailed, until finally at the very end when resistance no longer served any useful purpose, to save the lives of his remaining men Field Marshal  Friedrich Paulus disobeyed Hitler and surrendered.\",\n",
       " 'Battle_of_Tours': 'The Battle of Tours ( October 10,  732), often called Battle of Poitiers and also called in  Arabic بلاط الشهداء (Balâṭ al-Shuhadâ’) The Court of Martyrs was fought near the city of  Tours, close to the border between the Frankish realm and the independent region of  Aquitaine. The battle pitted Frankish and  Burgundian  forces under  Austrasian  Mayor of the Palace  Charles Martel against an army of the  Umayyad Caliphate led by  ‘Abd-al-Raḥmān al-Ghāfiqī, Governor-general of  al-Andalus. The Franks were victorious, ‘Abd-al-Raḥmān was killed, and Martel subsequently extended his authority in the south. Ninth-century chroniclers, who interpreted the outcome of the battle as divine judgment in his favour, gave Charles the nickname Martellus (\"The Hammer\"), possibly recalling  Judas Maccabeus (\"The Hammerer\") of  Maccabean revolt. Details of the battle, including its exact location and the exact number of combatants, cannot be determined from accounts that have survived.As later chroniclers increasingly came to praise Charles Martel as the champion of Christianity, pre-20th century historians began to characterize this battle as being the decisive turning point in the struggle against Islam. \"Most of the 18th and 19th century historians, like Gibbon, saw Poitiers (Tours), as a landmark battle that marked the high tide of the Muslim advance into Europe.\"  Leopold Von Ranke felt that \"Poitiers was the turning point of one of the most important epochs in the history of the world.\" While modern historians are divided as to whether or not the victory was responsible — as Gibbon and his generation of historians claimed — for saving Christianity and halting the conquest of Europe by Islam, the battle helped lay the foundations for the  Carolingian Empire, and Frankish domination of Europe for the next century. \"The establishment of Frankish power in western Europe shaped that continent\\'s destiny and the Battle of Tours confirmed that power.\" ',\n",

However, the U.S. and its  allies apparently gained a greater  tactical and  strategic advantage from the battle than Japan because the  Allied forces suffered fewer losses than the Japanese, who lost a significant amount of aircraft and experienced  aircrews. Also, Japanese reinforcements intended for  Guadalcanal were delayed and eventually delivered by naval  warships instead of  transport ships, giving the Allies more time to prepare for the Japanese counteroffensive and preventing the Japanese from landing heavy  artillery,  ammunition, and other  logistical  supplies that would have significantly assisted their forces in the struggle for the island.',\n",

In similar fashion to the battles of  Coral Sea, Midway, and the Eastern Solomons, the ships of the two adversaries were rarely in direct  visual range of each other. Instead, almost all attacks by both sides were mounted by carrier or land-based  aircraft.In an attempt to drive  Allied forces from  Guadalcanal and nearby islands, and end the stalemate which had existed since September 1942, the  Imperial Japanese Army planned a major ground offensive on Guadalcanal for October 20-25, 1942. In support of this offensive, and with the hope of engaging Allied naval forces, Japanese carriers and other large warships moved into a position near the southern Solomon Islands. From this location, the Japanese naval forces hoped to engage and decisively defeat any Allied (primarily U.S.) naval forces, especially carrier forces, that responded to the ground offensive. However, Allied naval forces also hoped to meet the Japanese naval forces in battle, with the same objectives of breaking the stalemate and decisively defeating their adversary.The Japanese ground offensive was defeated by Allied ground forces on October 20-25 in the  Battle for Henderson Field. Nevertheless, the naval warships and aircraft from the two adversaries confronted each other on the morning of October 26, 1942, just north of the  Santa Cruz Islands. After an exchange of carrier  air attacks, Allied  surface ships were forced to retreat from the battle area with the loss of one carrier sunk and another heavily damaged. However, the participating Japanese carrier forces also retreated due to high aircraft and  aircrew losses, and significant damage to two carriers. Although an apparent tactical victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk and damaged, the loss of many irreplaceable, veteran aircrews by the Japanese provided a long-term strategic advantage for the Allies, whose aircrew losses in the battle were relatively low, partially due to search and rescue efforts.',\n",

From the end of the Middle Ages until the seventeenth century, it was a prosperous centre of commerce and culture. From the sixteenth century until the Belgian revolution in 1830, Belgium, at that time called the  Southern Netherlands, was the site of many battles between the European powers, and has been dubbed \"the battlefield of Europe\" or \"the cockpit of Europe\".

The  mansion is surrounded by  formal gardens and a series of avenues leading to  follies within a greater wooded park. Belton has been described as a compilation of all that is finest of  Carolean architecture, the only truly  vernacular style of architecture that England had produced since the time of the  Tudors. The house has also been described as the most complete example of a typical English country house; the claim has even been made that Belton's principal facade was the inspiration for the modern  British motorway signs () which give directions to  stately home. Only  Brympton d'Evercy has been similarly lauded as the perfect English country house.For three hundred years, Belton House was the seat of the  Brownlow and Cust family, who had first acquired land in the area in the late 16th century. Between 1685 and 1688 the young Sir John Brownlow and his wife had the present mansion built. Despite great wealth they chose to build a modest country house rather than a grand contemporary  Baroque palace. The contemporary, if provincial, Carolean style was the selected choice of design. However, the new house was fitted with the latest  innovations such as sash windows for the principal rooms, and more importantly completely separate areas for the staff. As the Brownlows rose from  baronets to  barons upward to  earls and then once again became barons, successive generations made changes to the interior of the house which reflected their changing social position and tastes, yet the fabric and design of the house changed little.Following World War I (a period when the  Machine Gun Corps was based in the park), the Brownlows, like many of their  peers, were faced with mounting financial problems. In 1984 they gave the house away — complete with most of its contents. The recipients of their gift, the  National Trust, today fully opens Belton to the public. It is in a good state of repair and visited by many thousands of tourists each year.\",\n",

He served in government for three decades, twice as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom – the first and thus far only person of Jewish parentage to do so (although Disraeli was  baptised in the Anglican Church at an early age). Disraeli's most lasting achievement was the creation of the modern  Conservative Party after the  Corn Laws schism of 1846.Although a major figure in the  protectionist wing of the Conservative Party after 1844, Disraeli's relations with the other leading figures in the party, particularly  Lord Derby, the overall leader, were often strained. Not until the  1860s would Derby and Disraeli be on easy terms, and the latter's succession of the former assured. From 1852 onwards, Disraeli's career would also be marked by his often intense rivalry with William Ewart Gladstone, who eventually rose to become leader of the  Liberal Party. In this duel, Disraeli was aided by his warm friendship with Queen Victoria, who came to detest Gladstone during the latter's first premiership in the 1870s. In 1876 Disraeli was raised to the  peerage as the Earl of Beaconsfield, capping nearly four decades in the House of Commons.Before and during his political career, Disraeli was well-known as a literary and social figure, although his novels are not generally regarded as belonging to the first rank of Victorian literature.

As a scientist he was a major figure in the  history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. As a political writer and activist he, more than anyone, invented the idea of an American nation, and as a diplomat during the  American Revolution, he secured the  French alliance that made independence possible.Franklin was noted for his curiosity, his writings (popular, political and scientific), and his diversity of interests. His wise and scintillating writings are proverbial to this day. As a leader of the Enlightenment, he gained the recognition of scientists and intellectuals across Europe. An agent in London before the Revolution, and Minister to  France during it, he more than anyone defined the new nation in the minds of Europe. His success in securing French military and financial aid was the turning point for American victory over  Britain. He invented the lightning rod; he was an early proponent of  colonial unity; historians hail him as the \"First American\". The city of Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania marked Franklin\\'s 300th birthday in  January 2006 with a wide array of exhibitions, and events citing Franklin\\'s extraordinary accomplishments throughout his illustrious career.Born in Boston, Massachusetts to a devout Anglican tallow-maker, he was baptized at  Old South Meeting House. Franklin learned printing from his older brother and became a newspaper editor, printer, and merchant in Philadelphia, becoming very wealthy. He spent many years in England and published the famous  Poor Richard\\'s Almanac and the  Pennsylvania Gazette. He formed both the first  public lending library and  fire department in America as well as the  Junto, a political discussion club.He became a  national hero in America when he spearheaded the effort to have Parliament repeal the unpopular  Stamp Act. A diplomatic genius, Franklin was almost universally admired among the French as American minister to Paris, and was a major figure in the development of positive  Franco-American relations. From 1775 to 1776, Franklin was  Postmaster General under the  Continental Congress and from 1785 to his death in 1790 was  President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania. Towards the end of his life, he became one of the most prominent  abolitionists.Franklin was interested in science and technology, carrying out his famous electricity experiments and inventing, in addition to his very important lightning rod, the  Franklin stove,  catheter,  swimfins,  glass harmonica, and  bifocals. He also played a major role in establishing the  University of Pennsylvania and  Franklin and Marshall College.

In his journey he passed through large swathes of Europe, Asia, and Africa. His vivid descriptions of Asia preceded those of Marco Polo by one hundred years. With his broad education and vast knowledge of languages, Benjamin of Tudela was a major figure in the history of geography and  Jewish history.Benjamin set out on his 13-year journey in  1160, in what began as a pilgrimage to the  Holy Land. He may have hoped to settle there, but there is controversy about the reasons for his travels; for example, it has been suggested he may have had a commercial motive as well as a religious one. He took the \"long road\" stopping frequently, meeting people, visiting places, describing occupations and giving a demographic count of Jews in every town and country.Little is known of the facts of Benjamin\\'s life. In some sense the journey must have begun in the Spanish town of  Tudela, where today a street in the  aljama is named after him. However, the published version begins in the city of  Saragossa, further down the valley of the  Ebro, whence he proceeded north to France, and then set sail from the port of Marseilles. After visiting Rome and  Constantinople, he set off across Asia, visiting Syria and  Palestine before reaching Baghdad. From there he went to Persia, then cut back across the  Arabian Peninsula to Egypt and North Africa, returning to Spain in  1173. In all he visited over 300 cities including Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Damascus, Baghdad and beyond.He described his thirteen years abroad in a book, The Voyages of Benjamin (מסעות בנימין, or Masa\\'ot Binyamin, also known as ספר המסעות, Sefer ha-Masa\\'ot, The Book of Travels). This book describes the countries he visited, with an emphasis on the Jewish communities, including their total populations and the names of notable community leaders. He also described the customs of the local population, both Jewish and non-Jewish, with an emphasis on urban life there. There are also detailed descriptions of sites and landmarks he passed along the way, as well as important buildings and marketplaces. Benjamin is noted for not only telling facts, but citing his sources; historians regard him as highly trustworthy.The Voyages of Benjamin is an important work not only as a description of the Jewish communities, but also as a reliable source about the geography and  ethnography of the Middle Ages. As well some modern historians credit Benjamin as giving very accurate descriptions of every-day life in the Middle Ages. Originally written in Hebrew, it was translated in to Latin and later translated into most major European languages, receiving considerable attention in the sixteenth century.

A very sparse population extends into the whole Sahara and the northern part of the  Sahel. They belong to the  Afro-Asiatic languages phylum. There is a strong movement among  Berbers to unify the closely related northern Berber languages into a single standard, Tamazight.Among the Berber languages are  Tarifit or Riffi (northern Morocco),  Kabyle (Algeria) and  Tachelhit (central Morocco). Tamazight has been a written language, on and off, for almost 3000 years; however, this tradition has been frequently disrupted by various invasions. It was first written in the  Tifinagh alphabet, still used by the  Tuareg; the oldest dated inscription is from about 200 BC. Later between about 1000 AD and 1500 AD, it was written in the  Arabic alphabet (particularly by the  Shilha of Morocco); since the 20th century, it is often written in the Latin alphabet, especially among the  Kabyle. A variant of the  Tifinagh alphabet was recently made official in Morocco, while the Latin alphabet is official in Algeria, Mali, and Niger; however, both Tifinagh and Arabic are still widely used in Mali and Niger, while Latin and Arabic are still widely used in Morocco.After independence, all the Maghreb countries to varying degrees pursued a policy of \"Arabization\", aimed primarily at displacing French from its colonial position as the dominant language of education and literacy, but under which teaching, and use in certain highly public spheres, of both Berber languages and  Maghrebi Arabic dialect have been suppressed as well. This state of affairs was protested by Berbers in Morocco and Algeria - especially  Kabylie - and is now being addressed in both countries by introducing Berber language education and by recognizing Berber as a \"national language\", though not necessarily an official one. No such measures have been taken in the other Maghreb countries, whose Berber populations are much smaller. In Mali and Niger, there are a few schools that teach partially in  Tamasheq.',\n",

Part of the  Iron Curtain, the Berlin Wall was the most prominent part of the  GDR border system. Conceived by the  East German administration of  Walter Ulbricht and approved by Soviet leader  Nikita Khrushchev the wall was a long  separation barrier between  West Berlin and East Germany (the  German Democratic Republic), which closed the border between  East and West Berlin for a period of 28 years. It was built during the post-World War II period of  divided Germany, in an effort to stop the drain of labour and economic output associated with the daily migration of huge numbers of professionals and skilled workers from East to West Berlin, and the attendant  defections, which had political and economic consequences for the  Communist bloc. It effectively decreased emigration (escapes - \"Republikflucht\" in German) from 2.5 million between 1949 and 1962 to 5,000 between 1962 and 1989.However, the creation of the Wall was a propaganda disaster for East Germany and for the communist bloc as a whole. It became a key symbol of what Western powers regarded as Communist tyranny, particularly after the high-profile shootings of would-be defectors. Political liberalization in the late 1980s, associated with the decline of the Soviet Union, led to relaxed border restrictions in East Germany, culminating in mass demonstrations and the fall of the East German government. When a government statement that crossing of the border would be permitted was broadcast on  November 9,  1989, masses of East Germans approached and then crossed the wall, and were joined by crowds of West Germans in a celebratory atmosphere. The Wall was subsequently destroyed by a euphoric public over a period of several weeks, and its fall was the first step toward German reunification, which was formally concluded on  October 3,  1990.',\n",

       " 'Big_Bang': \"In  physical cosmology, the Big Bang is the scientific  theory that the universe emerged from a tremendously  dense and  hot state about 13.7 billion years ago. The theory is based on the observations indicating the expansion of  space (in accord with the  Robertson-Walker model of  general relativity) as indicated by the Hubble redshift of  distant galaxies taken together with the  cosmological principle. Extrapolated into the past, these  observations show that the universe has expanded from a state in which all the matter and energy in the universe was at an immense temperature and density. Physicists do not widely agree on what happened before this, although general relativity predicts a  gravitational singularity (for reporting on some of the more notable speculation on this issue, see  cosmogony).The term Big Bang is used both in a narrow sense to refer to a point in time when the observed expansion of the universe (Hubble's law) began — calculated to be 13.7  billion ( 1.37 × 1010) years ago (±2%) — and in a more general sense to refer to the prevailing cosmological  paradigm explaining the origin and expansion of the universe, as well as the composition of primordial matter through  nucleosynthesis as predicted by the  Alpher-Bethe-Gamow theory.From this  model,  George Gamow in 1948 was able to predict, at least qualitatively, the existence of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). The CMB was discovered in 1964 and further corroborated the Big Bang theory, giving it an additional advantage over its chief rival, the  steady state theory.\",\n",

Recent research suggests that a large percentage of stars are part of systems with at least two stars. Binary star systems are very important in  astrophysics, because observing their mutual orbits allows their  mass to be determined. The masses of many single stars can then be determined by extrapolations made from the observation of binaries.Binary stars are not the same as  optical double stars, which appear to be close together as seen from Earth, but may not be bound by gravity. Binary stars can either be distinguished optically (visual binaries) or by indirect techniques, such as  spectroscopy. If binaries happen to orbit in a plane containing our line of sight, they will  eclipse each other; these are called eclipsing binaries.The components of binary star systems can exchange mass, bringing their  evolution to stages that single stars cannot attain. Examples of binaries are Algol (an eclipsing binary), Sirius, and  Cygnus X-1 (of which one member is probably a black hole).',\n",

Though derived from biological sources, it is a processed  fuel that can be readily used in diesel-engined vehicles, which distinguishes biodiesel from the  straight vegetable oils (SVO) or  waste vegetable oils (WVO) used as fuels in some modified diesel vehicles.In this article\\'s context, biodiesel refers to alkyl esters made from the  transesterification of both  vegetable oils and/or  animal fats. Biodiesel is  biodegradable and non- toxic, and has significantly fewer emissions than petroleum-based  diesel when burned. There is much debate about the extent to which biodiesel can safely be used in conventional diesel engines without modification. Using biodiesel in unmodified engines can lead to problems, particularly blocked injectors, which in turn can lead to serious engine damage. The majority of vehicle manufacturers say using 100% biodiesel can damage their engines. In the UK, for example, most manufactuers only maintain their engine warranties for use with maximum 5% biodiesel - blended in with 95% conventional diesel - although this position is generally considered to be overly cautious. Peugeot and Citroen are an exception in that they have both recently announced that their HDI diesel engine can run on 30% biodiesel. Scania are another exception as they allow most of their engines to operate on 100% biodiesel.Biodiesel can also be used as a heating fuel in domestic and commercial boilers. A technical research paper No.7 published in the UK by the institute of plumbing and heating entitled \"Biodiesel Heating, Sustainable Heating for the Future\" by Andrew J. Robertson describes laboratory research and field trials project using pure biodiesel and biodiesel blends as a heating fuel in oil fired boilers. During the Biodiesel Expo 2006 in the UK, Andrew J. Robertson presented his biodiesel heating oil research from his technical paper and suggested that B20 biodiesel could reduce UK household CO2 emissions by 1.5 million tonnes per year and would only require around 330,000 hectares of arable land for the required biodiesel for the UK heating oil sector. The paper also suggests that existing oil boilers can easily and cheaply be converted to biodiesel if B20 biodiesel is used.Biodiesel can be distributed using today\\'s infrastructure, and its use and production are increasing rapidly. Fuel stations are beginning to make biodiesel available to  consumers, and a growing number of transport fleets use it as an additive in their fuel. Biodiesel is generally more expensive to purchase than petroleum diesel but this differential may diminish due to  economies of scale, the rising cost of petroleum and government tax subsidies.',\n",

It is a  renewable energy source, unlike other  natural resources such as petroleum, coal and  nuclear fuels.One definition of biofuel is any fuel with an 80% minimum content by volume of materials derived from living organisms harvested within the ten years preceding its manufacture.Like coal and petroleum, biomass is a form of stored  solar energy. The energy of the sun is \"captured\" through the process of photosynthesis in growing plants. (See also:  Systems ecology) One advantage of biofuel in comparison to most other fuel types is it is biodegradable, and thus relatively harmless to the environment if spilled. 25 Years: The Down Fall of Petrochemical Fuels Intro Petroleum, fossil fuel, fact it is not an inexhaustible source. Current life depends on petroleum, and yet we use it faster than we can make it. To sustain current life, the usage of an alternative fuel, in replacement of petroleum, is critical. The alternative fuels are much healthier for nature and the community. Corn fuel and cooking oils are also inexhaustible. Why Alternate? The alternate fuels have some pros that are a deciding factor among many to switch to the alternate source. The petrochemicals cause many smog problems in cities and suburbs that surround it, therefore causing children and adults alike to have health issues. All alternative fuel sources are much healthier, such as corn-based fuel called gasohol. Also, unlike petrochemicals, the alternative fuel sources are unlimited. The use of alternative fuels such as corn and soybean fuel will increase the economy in the U.S. and decrease the amount of money we send to the Middle East for oil. Also, it \"Costs MUCH less than . . . diesel.\" (\"Quick Breakdown: Vegetable\" par.11.) The alternative fuel will also decrease the smog problems, in places like California, New York City, and Chicago.What’s Available? Currently there are already alternative fuels on the market, though they are hard to locate. Vegetable oil is one good source of fuel; there is even a bus, which uses vegetable oil for fuel, which travels the country promoting the usage of alternative fuels. Also, vegetable oil is“Usually gathered from cooperating restaurants . . . ” (“Quick Breakdown: Vegetable” par. 12) Another fuel source is gasohol which can be made out of soybeans and corn. Also, cooking oil in general will work as fuel. The Impact. In 1970 the Clean Air Act was instated for the protection of the U.S. environment and society. “Vegetable oil and Biodiesel are virtually sulfur free . . . ” (“Quick Breakdown: Vegetable” par. 17) Switching to alternative fuels would support this act. The U.S. would also stop having to export money to the Middle East and start paying off our 8.66 trillion dollar debt. This would affect petroleum-based fuel companies. They will have to adapt for the betterment of the country. This would also hurt the Middle East’s economy. Though that is true, the use of corn and soybean fuels will spike the U.S.’s, specifically the mid west’s, economy upward. It would also promote farmers to work and it would increase their profit.',\n",

Major research efforts in the field include sequence alignment,  gene finding,  genome assembly,  protein structure alignment,  protein structure prediction, prediction of  gene expression and  protein-protein interactions, and the modeling of evolution.The terms bioinformatics and computational biology are often used interchangeably. However bioinformatics more properly refers to the creation and advancement of algorithms, computational and statistical techniques, and theory to solve formal and practical problems posed by or inspired from the management and analysis of biological data. Computational biology, on the other hand, refers to hypothesis-driven investigation of a specific biological problem using computers, carried out with experimental and simulated data, with the primary goal of discovery and the advancement of biological knowledge. A similar distinction is made by  National Institutes of Health in their  working definitions of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, where it is further emphasized that there is a tight coupling of developments and knowledge between the more hypothesis-driven research in computational biology and technique-driven research in bioinformatics. Computational biology also includes lesser known but equally important subdisciplines such as computational  biochemistry and computational  biophysics.A common thread in projects in bioinformatics and computational biology is the use of mathematical tools to extract useful information from data produced by high-throughput biological techniques such as  genome sequencing.

Some, such as  Common Swifts, stay aloft for days at a time, even sleeping on the wing.Common characteristics of birds include a bony  beak with no teeth, the laying of hard-shelled  eggs, high  metabolic rate, a 4-chambered heart, and a light but strong  skeleton. Most birds are characterised by  flight, though the  ratites are flightless, and several other species, particularly on islands, have also lost this ability. Flightless birds include the penguins, ostrich,  kiwi, and the extinct Dodo. Flightless species are vulnerable to extinction when humans or the mammals they introduce arrive in their habitat.

With an average mass of 1.6 kg it is one of the smallest living species of cats. Females have an average weight of 1.3 kg, males 1.9 kg (Sliwa 2004). The head-body length is 36-52 cm, plus 13-20 cm tail, shoulder height is 25 cm. The head appears oversized relative to the rest of the body. The  fur is cinnamon buff to tawny or off-white with distinct solid blackish spots which are joined to bands behind the shoulders and that form rings around the legs and tail. As the name implies, the soles of the feet are black. Black-footed cats live  solitarily, are  active at night and thus rarely seen. In the daytime they hide in  springhaas (Pedetes capensis)  burrows, under rock slabs and shrubs, and within hollow termitaria.Due to its small size the black-footed cats hunts mainly small prey species like  rodents and small birds, but may also take white-quilled  bustards and  Cape hares, the latter heavier than themselves. Insects and spiders provide only less than 1% of the prey mass consumed (Sliwa 1994, Sliwa 2006). Black-footed cats are shy animals, that seek refuge at the slightest disturbance.

Almost simultaneous  epidemics occurred across large portions of Asia and the Middle East during the same period, indicating that the European outbreak was actually part of a multi-regional pandemic. Including Middle Eastern lands, India and China, the Black Death killed at least 75 million people. The same disease is thought to have returned to Europe every generation with varying degrees of  intensity and fatality until the 1700s. Notable later outbreaks include the  Italian Plague of 1629-1631, the  Great Plague of London (1665–1666), the  Great Plague of Vienna (1679), the  Great Plague of Marseilles in 1720–1722 and the 1771 plague in Moscow. There is some controversy over the identity of the disease, but in its virulent form the disease appears to have disappeared from Europe in the 18th century. Bubonic plague survives in other parts of the world (Central and Oriental Africa, Madagascar, Asia, some parts of South America) and was responsible for a pandemic in the early 20th century.The Black Death had a drastic effect on Europe\\'s population, irrevocably changing Europe\\'s social structure. It was a serious blow to the Roman Catholic Church, Europe\\'s predominant religious institution at the time, and resulted in widespread persecution of minorities such as Jews, Muslims, foreigners, beggars and  lepers. The uncertainty of daily survival created a general mood of  morbidity influencing people to live for the moment, as illustrated by  Giovanni Boccaccio in  The Decameron (1353).The initial fourteenth-century European event was called the \"Great Mortality\" by contemporary writers and, with later outbreaks, became known as the \\'Black Death\\'. It has been popularly thought that the name came from a striking symptom of the disease, called  acral necrosis, in which sufferers\\' skin would blacken due to subdermal haemorrhages.

In the early  1980s only five Black Robins survived but were saved from extinction by  Don Merton and his team, and by \"Old Blue\", the last remaining female.All of the surviving black robins are descended from \"Old Blue\", unfortunately giving little genetic variation among the population and creating an extreme  population bottleneck. Interestingly, this seems to have caused no  inbreeding problems, leading to speculation that the species has passed through several such population reductions in its evolutionary past and thus losing any  alleles that could cause deleterious inbreeding effects. It was generally assumed that the  minimum viable population protecting from  inbreeding depression was around 50 individuals, but this is now known to be an inexact average, with the actual numbers being below 10 in rapidly-reproducing small-island species such as the Black Robin, to several hundred in long-lived continental species with a wide distribution (such as elephants or tigers).The species is still  endangered, but now numbers around 250 individuals in a single population on tiny  Little Mangere Island. Ongoing restoration of habitat and eradication of introduced predators is being undertaken so that the population of this and other endangered Chatham  endemics can be spread to several populations, decreasing the risk of extinction by natural disasters or similar  stochastic events.The binomial commemorates the New Zealand botanist  Henry H.

       " 'Black_panther': 'The black panther is the common name for a black specimen (a  melanistic variant) of any of several  species of cats. Zoologically speaking, the term panther is synonymous with leopard. The  genus name Panthera is a  taxonomic category that contains all the species of a particular group of  felids. In North America, the term panther is commonly used for the  puma; in Latin America it is most often used to mean a  jaguar. Elsewhere in the world it refers to the  leopard (originally individual animals with longer tails were deemed panthers and others were leopards; it is a common misconception that the term panther necessarily refers a melanistic individual). Melanism is most common in jaguars (Panthera onca) - where it is due to a dominant gene mutation - and  leopards (Panthera pardus) - where it is due to a  recessive gene mutation. Close examination of one of these black cats will show that the typical markings are still there, and are simply hidden by the surplus of the  black pigment  melanin. Cats with  melanism can co-exist with litter mates that do not have this condition. In cats that hunt mainly at night the condition is not detrimental.  White panthers also exist, these being  albino or  leucistic individuals of the same three species.It is probable that melanism is a favorable evolutionary  mutation with a selective advantage under certain conditions for its possessor, since it is more commonly found in regions of dense forest, where light levels are lower. Melanism can also be linked to beneficial mutations in the immune system.',\n",

The same fruit is also used to produce white pepper and green pepper. Black pepper is native to  South India and is extensively cultivated there and elsewhere in tropical regions. The fruit, known as a peppercorn when dried, is a small  drupe five millimetres in diameter, dark red when fully mature, containing a single seed.Dried, ground pepper is one of the most common spices in European  cuisine and its descendants, having been known and prized since antiquity for both its flavour and its use as a medicine. The spiciness of black pepper is due to the chemical  piperine. Ground black peppercorn, usually referred to simply as \"pepper\", may be found on nearly every dinner table in some parts of the world, often alongside table salt.The word pepper is derived from the  Sanskrit pippali, via the Latin piper and Old English pipor. The Latin word is also the source of German pfeffer, French poivre, Dutch peper, and other similar forms. In the 16th century, pepper started referring to the unrelated  New World  chile peppers as well. Pepper was used in a figurative sense meaning \"spirit\" or \"energy\" at least as far back as the 1840s; in the early 20th century, this was shortened to pep.',\n",

Populations are resident except for northern birds which move south in winter.Blackbirds are 23.5 to 29 cm in length. They are  omnivorous, eating a wide range of insects,  earthworms, seeds and berries. They nest in bushes or similar, laying several (usually 4) bluish- green-grey  eggs with brown reddish marks in a neat cup-shaped  nest.They do not form flocks, although several birds, especially migrants, may be loosely associated in a suitable habitat. Female blackbirds are especially fierce in the spring when they compete and fight with each other for a good nesting territory. Male birds are also competitive and will protect their territory by chasing away other males. If a fight between male Blackbirds does occur it is usually short and the intruder is soon chased away.Adult males are all black except for a yellow eye-ring and bill. Adult female birds and juvenile birds have brown  plumage and brown beaks and do not have a yellow eye-ring. Overall, juvenile birds are a slightly lighter brown than female birds and very young juvenile birds have somewhat speckled chests.The male sings its varied and melodious song from trees, rooftops or other elevated perches.The Blackbird has been introduced to many parts of the world outside its native range. In Australia and New Zealand it is considered a pest and has an effect on natural  ecosystems.The blackbird is also the  national bird of Sweden.',\n",

It is hardier than most warblers, partly because it will readily eat small berries as well as the more typical warbler insect diet. An interesting development in recent years is for substantial numbers of central European birds to winter in gardens in southern England. Presumably the ready availability of food, particularly from  bird tables, and the avoidance of migration over the  Alps, compensate for the sub-optimal climate. Bearhop et al. (2005) have recently reported that the birds wintering in England tend to mate only with each other, because they arrive back from the wintering grounds earlier than those wintering in the Mediterranean. The authors suggest that the division of the population into different migration routes may be the first step in the evolution of distinct species.This is a bird of shady woodlands with ground cover for nesting. The nest is built in low shrub, and 3-6  eggs are laid.This is a robust warbler, mainly grey in  plumage. Although most warblers have the sexes identical, several Sylvia species have distinct male and female plumages. The Blackcap is an example: the male has the small black cap from which the species gets its name, whereas in the female the cap is light brown.The song is a pleasant chattering with some clearer notes like a Blackbird. The song can be confused with that of the  Garden Warbler.A separate race of the Blackcap, heineken, occurs on the  Macaronesian islands.',\n",

One such bonus was a 10-to-1 payout if the player\\'s hand consisted of the ace of spades and a black Jack (either the Jack of clubs or the Jack of spades). This hand was called a \"blackjack\" and the name stuck to the game even though the bonus payout was soon abolished.

The film features  Harrison Ford,  Rutger Hauer,  Sean Young,  Edward James Olmos and  Daryl Hannah.The film depicts a  dystopian Los Angeles in November 2019 in which genetically manufactured beings called  replicants, physically identical to adult humans, are used for dangerous and degrading work in Earth\\'s \" off-world colonies.\" Replicants became illegal on Earth after a bloody  mutiny. Specialist police units — blade runners — hunt down and \"retire\" (i.e. kill) escaped replicants on Earth. The plot primarily focuses on a particularly brutal and cunning group of replicants hiding in Los Angeles and a semi-retired blade runner, named Rick Deckard, who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment.Blade Runner initially polarized  critics; some were displeased with the pacing, while others enjoyed its thematic complexity. The film performed poorly in North American theaters but achieved success overseas. Despite poor early ticket sales, it has since become a  cult classic. Blade Runner has been hailed for its production design, one said to depict a \"retrofitted future\". The film is credited with prefiguring important concerns of the 21st century, such as globalization and  genetic engineering. It remains a leading example of cyberpunk and  neo-noir. Blade Runner brought author  Philip K.

       " 'Blaise_Pascal': \"Blaise Pascal (pronounced [blez pɑskɑl]), ( June 19,  1623 –  August 19,  1662) was a French  mathematician,  physicist, and religious philosopher. He was a  child prodigy who was educated by his father. Pascal's earliest work was in the natural and applied sciences where he made important contributions to the construction of mechanical  calculators, the study of  fluids, and clarified the concepts of  pressure and  vacuum by generalizing the work of  Evangelista Torricelli. Pascal also wrote powerfully in defense of the  scientific method.He was a mathematician of the first order. Pascal helped create two major new areas of research. He wrote a significant treatise on the subject of  projective geometry at the age of sixteen and corresponded with  Pierre de Fermat from 1654 and later on probability theory, strongly influencing the development of modern economics and  social science.Following a mystical experience in late 1654, he abandoned his scientific work and devoted himself to philosophy and  theology. His two most famous works date from this period: the  Lettres provinciales and the  Pensées. However, he had suffered from ill-health throughout his life and his new interests were ended by his early death two months after his 39th birthday.\",\n",
       " 'Blitzkrieg': \" Blitzkrieg \\xa0 (German, literally lightning war or flash war) is a popular name for an offensive  operational-level  military doctrine which involves an initial bombardment followed by employment of mobile forces attacking with speed and surprise to prevent an enemy from implementing a coherent  defense. The founding principles of these types of operations were developed in the 19th Century by various nations, and adapted in the years after World War I, largely by the German  Wehrmacht, to incorporate modern weapons and vehicles as a method to help prevent trench warfare and  linear warfare in future conflicts. The first practical implementations of these concepts coupled with modern technology were instituted by the Wehrmacht in the opening battles of World War II. While operations in Poland were rather conventional, subsequent battles — particularly the invasions of France,  The Netherlands and initial operations in the  Soviet Union — were effective owing to surprise penetrations, general enemy unpreparedness and an inability to react swiftly enough to German offensive operations. That the German Army quickly defeated numerically and technically superior enemies in France led many analysts to believe that a new system of warfare had been invented.The generally accepted definition of blitzkrieg operations include the use of  maneuver rather than  attrition to defeat an opponent, and describe operations using combined arms concentration of mobile assets at a focal point, armour closely supported by mobile infantry, artillery and close air support assets. These tactics required the development of specialized support vehicles, new methods of communication, new  tactics, and an effective decentralized  command structure. Broadly speaking, blitzkrieg operations required the development of  mechanized infantry,  self-propelled artillery and engineering assets that could maintain the rate of advance of the tanks. German forces avoided direct combat in favour of interrupting an enemy's communications,  decision-making, logistics and of reducing  morale. In combat, blitzkrieg left little choice for the slower defending forces but to clump into defensive pockets that were  encircled and then destroyed by following German  infantry.Tactically speaking, once the weakest area of defence is identified, tactical bombers would strike at logistical, communication, and supply targets while field and self-propelled artillery units struck at defence installations. These bombardments were then pre-ceded by probing attacks and smoke screens to conceal the main armoured spearhead, and once the main armoured force broke through the designated strike area, motorized infantry would then fan out behind the armoured spearhead to capture or destroy any enemy forces encircled by panzer and mechanized infantry units or tactically important objectives like bridges, airfields, supply depots, rail yards, naval ports, anti-aircraft batteries, and radar installations.\",\n",

       " 'Blood_type': \"A total of 29  human blood group systems are recognized by the  International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT). The most important of these are the ABO blood group system and the  Rhesus blood group system.Each blood group is represented by a substance on the surface of  red blood cells (RBCs). These substances are important because they contain specific sequences of  amino acid and  carbohydrate which are  antigenic. As well as being on the surface of RBCs, some of these antigens are also present on the cells of other tissues. A complete blood type describes the set of 29 substances on the surface of RBCs, and an individual's blood type is one of the many possible combinations of blood group antigens; usually only the ABO blood group system and the presence or absence of the  Rhesus D antigen (also known as the Rhesus factor) are determined and used to describe the blood type. Over 600 different blood group antigens have been found, many of these being very rare. If an individual is exposed to a blood group antigen that is not recognised as self, the individual can become sensitized to that antigen; the  immune system makes specific  antibodies which binds specifically to a particular blood group antigen and an immunological memory against that particular antigen is formed. These antibodies can bind to antigens on the surface of transfused  red blood cells (or other tissue cells) often leading to destruction of the cells by recruitment of other components of the immune system. Knowledge of an individual's blood type is important to identify appropriate  blood for  transfusion or tissue for  organ transplantation.Several different RBC surface antigens stemming from one  allele (or very closely linked  genes) are collectively labeled as a blood group system (or blood group). The two most important blood group systems were discovered during early experiments with blood transfusion, the ABO group in  1901 and the  Rhesus group in  1937. These two blood groups are reflected in the common nomenclature A positive, O negative, etc. with letters referring to the ABO group and positive/negative to the presence/absence of the RhD antigen of the Rhesus group. Development of the  Coombs test in  1945 and the advent of  transfusion medicine led to discovery of more blood groups. The  Coombs test is used routinely in the screening of blood for blood group antibodies in the preparation of blood for  transfusion.Blood types are  inherited and represent contributions from both parents. Some blood types are rare, and are primarily found in certain ethnic groups. Some blood types are associated with inheritance of other diseases, for example the  Kell antigen is associated with  McLeod syndrome. Certain blood types may affect susceptibility to infections, an example being the resistance to specific malaria species seen in individuals lacking the  Duffy antigen. Very rarely, a person's blood type changes through addition or suppression of an antigen in  infection or  malignancy. Transfusion reactions can occur if a person is transfused with blood of a different blood type. Mismatches involving minor antigens or weak antibodies may lead to minor problems; however, more serious incompatibilities can lead to a more vigorous  immune response with massive  RBC destruction,  low blood pressure, and even  death.Often,  pregnant women carry a  fetus with a different blood type to their own, and sometimes the mother forms antibodies against the red blood cells of the fetus, which causes  hemolysis of fetal RBCs and leads to low fetal blood counts, a condition known as  hemolytic disease of the newborn.\",\n",

There is a pronounced crest on the head. The colour changes to black, sky-blue and white barring on the wing primaries and the tail. The bird has an off-white underside, with a black collar around the neck and sides of the head and a white face.Blue Jays reside over a very large area of the eastern side of North America from  Newfoundland in the northeast to Florida in the southeast and westward to  Texas and the mid-west and eastern  Colorado in the north. It is mainly a bird of mixed woodland, including American  beech and various  oak species, but also of parks and gardens in some towns and cities. West of the Rockies, it is replaced by the closely related  Steller\\'s Jay.Its food is sought both on the ground and in trees and includes virtually all known types of plant and animal sources, such as acorns and beech mast, weed seeds, grain, fruits and other berries, peanuts, bread, meat, eggs and nestlings, small invertebrates of many types, scraps in town parks and bird-table food.Its occasionally aggressive behaviour at feeding stations, plus a reputation for occasionally destroying the nests and eggs of other birds, has made the Blue Jay unwelcome at some bird feeders. However, these are clever and adaptable birds who are good survivors and have adapted well to human presence. They are particularly fond of peanuts and sunflower seeds.Any suitable tree or large bush may be used for nesting and both sexes build the nest and rear the young, though only the female broods them. There are usually 4–5 eggs laid and incubated over 16–18 days. The young are fledged usually between 17–21 days. Blue Jays typically form  monogamous pair bonds for life.Although this bird is generally found year round through most of its range, some northern birds do move into the southern parts of the range. These birds migrate in the daytime.The voice is typical of most jays in being varied, but the most commonly recognized sound is the alarm call, which is a loud, almost gull-like scream. There is also a high-pitched jayer-jayer call that increases in speed as the bird becomes more agitated. Blue Jays will use these calls to band together to drive a predator such as a hawk away from their nest.Blue Jays also have a quiet, almost subliminal call which they use among themselves in close proximity. In fact, they can make a large variety of sounds, and individuals may vary perceptibly in their calling style.As with other blue-hued birds, the Blue Jay\\'s coloration is not derived by pigments, but is the result of light  refraction due to the internal structure of the feathers; if a Blue Jay feather is crushed, the blue disappears as the structure is destroyed. This is referred to as  structural coloration.The Blue Jay is the  provincial bird of  Prince Edward Island and gave its name to the  Toronto Blue Jays baseball team.Blue Jays in captivity are generally aggressive toward other birds.

       " 'Bobcat': 'The Bobcat (Lynx rufus, or commonly felis rufus) is a wild cat native to North America. They are found mostly in the United States, southern Canada, and northern Mexico. The bobcat is an adaptable animal that inhabits wooded areas as well as semi-desert, urban, and swampland environments. They live in a set home range which shifts in size with the season. They utilize several methods to mark their territorial boundaries including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces.In appearance, the bobcat has characteristic black bars on its forelegs and tail. They also have prominent, pointed ears with short tufts of black hair at the tip. The name is derived from their stubby black-tipped tails that, unlike those of other species of Lynx, have a white underside. Their coat is most often light gray or various shades of brown in colour, with varying degrees of black spots either dispersed along much of their body or relegated to the otherwise white underparts. The bobcat is twice as large as a house cat but typically smaller than the related  Canada lynx. The adult male, averaging 36\\xa0inches (90\\xa0cm) in length, and weighing from 16 to 30\\xa0pounds (7 to 14\\xa0kg), is generally 30-40% larger than the female.Bobcats are carnivorous animals which will hunt anything from insects and small rodents to large deer, but often show a preference for rabbits and hares. What they hunt will depend on location and habitat, season, and scarcity of prey. The bobcat breeds from winter into the spring and has a gestation period of about two months. The kittens will stay with the mother until about a year old.',\n",

The kingdom was annexed as if conquered, Boudica was flogged and her daughters raped, and Roman financiers called in their loans.In 60 or 61, while the Roman governor,  Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, was leading a campaign on the island of  Anglesey in north Wales, Boudica led the Iceni, along with the  Trinovantes and others, in revolt.

One of the largest animals ever to walk the earth, it has become one of the most famous of all dinosaurs and is widely recognised worldwide.For many decades, Brachiosaurus was the  largest dinosaur known. It has since been discovered that a number of giant  titanosaurians ( Argentinosaurus, for example) surpassed Brachiosaurus in terms of sheer mass. More recently, another  brachiosaurid, Sauroposeidon, has also been discovered; based on incomplete fossil evidence, it too is likely to have outweighed Brachiosaurus.Brachiosaurus is often considered to be the largest dinosaur known from a relatively complete fossilized skeleton. However, the most complete specimens, including the Brachiosaurus in the  Humboldt Museum of Berlin (excavated in Africa, the tallest mounted skeleton in the world), are members of the species B. brancai which some scientists consider to be part of a separate  genus,  Giraffatitan. The holotype material of the type species, B. altithorax. includes a sequence of seven posterior dorsal vertebrae, sacrum, proximal caudal vertebra, coracoid, humerus, femur and ribs: enough from which to estimate size.Based on a complete composite skeleton, Brachiosaurus attained 25  metres (82  feet) in length and was probably able to raise its head about 13 metres (42 ft) above ground level.

These extreme estimates can be discarded as that of Russell et al. was based on limb-bone allometry rather than a body model, and that of Colbert on an outdated and overweight model.

Wheat bran (miller\\'s bran) is very effective in treating  constipation.Bran is often used to enrich breads (notably  muffins) and  breakfast cereals, especially for the benefit of those wishing to increase their intake of dietary fibre. Bran may also be used for  pickling, as in the  tsukemono of Japan.Rice bran finds particularly many uses in Japan, where it is known as nuka (糠; ぬか). Besides using it for pickling, Japanese people also add it to the water when  boiling  bamboo shoots, and use it for  dish washing. In  Kitakyushu City, it is called Jinda and used for stewing fish, such as  sardine.Rice bran is a by-product of the rice milling process, and it contains various antioxidants that impart beneficial effects on human health. It is well known that a major rice bran fraction contains 12%-13% oil and highly unsaponifiable components (4.3%). This fraction contains tocotrienol, gamma-oryzanol, and beta-sitosterol; all these constituents may contribute to the lowering of the plasma levels of the various parameters of the lipid profile. Rice bran also contains a high level of dietary fibers (beta-glucan, pectin, and gum). In addition, it also contains 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid (ferulic acid), which may also be a component of the structure of non-lignified cell walls.The high oil content of bran makes it subject to  rancidification, one of the reasons that is often separated from the grain before storage or further processing. The bran itself can be heat-treated to increase its longevity .Eating foods rich in bran became somewhat of a health craze in the late  1970s and early  1980s, with massive promotion of bran cereals and  granola. In the late  1980s, there was the \" oat bran craze,\" with oat products in all shapes and sizes flooding the market (including  potato chips with oat bran added), claiming to lower blood  cholesterol and fight  heart disease. This craze peaked in  1989 and was short-lived, as studies in the early  1990s showed that oat bran only modestly reduced cholesterol. However, in January  1997, the  Food and Drug Administration decided (with some controversy) that food with a lot of oat bran or rolled oats can carry a label claiming it may reduce the risk of heart disease, when combined with a low-fat diet. As of  2005, this fact still appears on many  oatmeal packages.Recently rice bran fraction derived from Driselase treatment prevents high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia  . Driselase is a commercial plant cell wall-degrading enzyme mixture containing cellulase, xylanase, and laminarinase; however, it is esterase-free.Bran oil may be also extracted for use by itself for industrial purposes (such as in the paint industry ), or as a  cooking oil, such as  rice bran oil.Bran is widely used as a major component in pet foods for rabbits and  guinea pigs.Bran is also known to absorb large amounts of water and expand, which has led some to claim that bran helps lead to satiety by filling up the stomach with added volume.',\n",

The delegates deliberated upon and signed the Bretton Woods Agreements during the first three weeks of July 1944.Setting up a system of rules, institutions, and procedures to regulate the international monetary system, the planners at Bretton Woods established the  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) (now one of five institutions in the World Bank Group) and the  International Monetary Fund (IMF). These organizations became operational in 1946 after a sufficient number of countries had ratified the agreement.The chief features of the Bretton Woods system were an obligation for each country to adopt a  monetary policy that maintained the  exchange rate of its currency within a fixed value—plus or minus one percent—in terms of gold; and the ability of the IMF to bridge temporary imbalances of payments. In the face of increasing strain, the system collapsed in 1971, following the United States' suspension of convertibility from dollars to gold.Until the early 1970s, the Bretton Woods system was effective in controlling conflict and in achieving the common goals of the leading states that had created it, especially the United States.\",\n",

       " 'British_English': 'British English (BrE) is a term used to distinguish the form of the English language used in the British Isles from forms used elsewhere. It includes all the varieties of English used within the Isles, including those found in England, Scotland, Wales, and the island of Ireland. Though the term is standard, some find it inappropriate as logically  Scottish English is included in British English, implying the existence of English as spoken in England as a category, but \" English English\" is cumbersome, and suggests that English refers to the language as spoken in England. The term British English is used especially by those outside the British Isles, as well as by linguists and lexicographers; British people themselves generally use the term \\'Standard English\\' or merely \\'English\\'.As with English around the world, the English language as used in the United Kingdom and Ireland is governed by convention rather than formal code: there is no equivalent body to the  Académie française, and the authoritative dictionaries (e.g.  Oxford English Dictionary,  Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English,  Chambers Dictionary,  Collins Dictionary) record usage rather than prescribe it. As a result there is significant variation in grammar, usage, spelling, and vocabulary. In addition, vocabulary and usage change with time; words are freely borrowed from other languages and other strains of English, and  neologisms are frequent.While there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in formal written English in the UK and Ireland, the forms of spoken English used vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, both geographically and socially, so the concept of \"British English\" is difficult to apply to the spoken language.  Dialects and  accents vary not only between the nations of the British Isles, for example in  Scotland,  Northern Ireland and  Wales, but also within these countries themselves. There are also differences in the English spoken by different socio-economic groups in any particular region. The written form of the language, as taught in schools, is the same as in the rest of the English-speaking world (except North America), with a slight emphasis on words whose usage varies amongst the different regions of the UK. For example, although the words \" wee\" and \"little\" are interchangeable in some contexts, one is more likely to see \"wee\" written by a Scottish or Northern Irish person than by an English person. In publishing, English English norms tend to be used.For historical reasons dating back to the rise of London in the 9th century, the form of language spoken in London and the  East Midlands became standard English within the Court, and ultimately became the basis for generally accepted use in the law, government, literature and education within the British Isles. To a great extent, modern British spelling was standardised in  Samuel Johnson\\'s  A Dictionary of the English Language ( 1755), although previous writers had also played a significant role in this and much has changed since 1755. Scotland, which only underwent parliamentary union in 1707, still has a few independent aspects of standardisation, especially within its autonomous legal system.The widespread usage of English across the world is partly attributable to the former power of the British Empire, and this is reflected in the use of British written forms in many parts of the world. The most common form of English used by the British ruling class is that of south-east England (the area around the capital, London, and the ancient English university towns of  Oxford and Cambridge). This form of the language is associated with  Received Pronunciation (RP), which is still regarded, incorrectly, by many people outside the UK as \"the British accent\". However, only approximately 5 percent of Britons speak RP, and it has evolved quite markedly over the last 40 years. Moreover, there is much more tolerance of variation than there was in the past.From the second half of the 20th century to the present day, the preeminence of the English language has been augmented by the economic, military, political and cultural dominance of the United States in world affairs. Nevertheless, the British Isles retains a major cultural influence in particular on the English used, as a first or additional language, in some  Commonwealth countries and former British colonies (including influence to a greater degree in India, South Africa, New Zealand and Hong Kong, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, but to a lesser degree in Australia, and only to a limited extent in Canada).

Parliament also includes the Sovereign and the  upper house, the House of Lords; the House of Commons is the dominant branch. The House of Commons is a democratically elected body, consisting of 646 members, who are known as \" Members of Parliament\" or MPs. Members are elected by the  first-past-the-post system of election, holding office until Parliament is dissolved (a maximum of five years). Each member is elected by, and represents, an electoral district known as a  constituency. The House of Commons is the source of the vast majority of  government ministers and every Prime Minister since 1902, with the very brief exception of  Sir Alec Douglas-Home in 1963, has been drawn from it (Home did actually rule from the House of Commons, however, taking a seat in the House shortly after being chosen as Prime Minister).The House of Commons evolved at some point during the 14th century and has been in continuous existence since. The House of Commons (the \"lower house\") was once far less powerful than the House of Lords (the \"upper house\"), but is now by far the dominant branch of Parliament. The House of Commons\\' legislative powers exceed those of the House of Lords; under the  Parliament Act 1911, the Lords\\' power to reject most bills was reduced to a mere delaying power. Moreover, the Government of the United Kingdom is answerable to the House of Commons; the Prime Minister stays in office only as long as he or she retains the support of the lower house.The full, formal style and title of the House of Commons is The Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled. The term \"Commons\" derives from the  Norman French word communes, referring to the geographic and collective communities of their representatives. It is often misunderstood that \"Commons\" comes from the word \"commoners\", referring to those sitting in the House, similar to the way in which the name \"House of Lords\" indicates that those sitting in the \" Other Place\" are elevated to the  Peerage. This explanation, however, is ahistorical. Both Houses, the Commons and Lords, meet in the Palace of Westminster.

See the Terminology section below for details of the controversy.There are two sovereign states located on the islands: the  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The group also includes the Isle of Man, a United Kingdom  crown dependency. Both states, but not the Isle of Man, are members of the European Union. Between 1801 and 1922, Great Britain and Ireland together formed the  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, Ireland left the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom, except for six counties in the north east of the island, which became known as Northern Ireland.The islands encompass an area south to north from  Pednathise Head to  Out Stack, Shetland in the United Kingdom, and west to east from  Tearaght Island in the Republic of Ireland to  Lowestoft Ness in the United Kingdom, containing more than 6,000 islands, amounting to a total land area of 121,674\\xa0 square miles (315,134\\xa0km²). The British Isles are largely low lying and fertile, though with significant mountainous areas in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and the north of England. The regional geology is complex, formed by the drifting together of separate regions and shaped by glaciation.The islands were named after the  Priteni, an ancient name for the Irish and British pre-Roman inhabitants; however, on its own, the dominant modern meaning of the adjective \" British\" is \"of Great Britain or of the United Kingdom or its people\", so the term \"British Isles\" can be mistakenly interpreted to imply that the Republic of Ireland is part of the United Kingdom. The Irish government\\'s policy is that the term is not used by the government and is without any official status, as stated by Minister for Foreign Affairs Dermot Ahern in 2005; the media in the Republic of Ireland also rarely use it.

       " 'British_monarchy': 'The British monarch or Sovereign is the  head of state of the United Kingdom and in the  British overseas territories. The current British monarchy can trace its line back to the Anglo-Saxon period, but derives its most ancient pedigree by tracing its line through the  Kings of Scots. During the ninth century, Wessex came to dominate other kingdoms in England, especially as a result of the extinction of rival lines in England during the First  Viking Age, and during the tenth century  England was consolidated into a single realm. The English and  Scots crowns were united in the person of a single monarch in 1603 when James VI of Scots acceded to the throne of England. The kingdoms themselves were joined in the Acts of Union 1707, to form  Great Britain.The powers of the monarchy, known as the  Royal Prerogative, are still very extensive. Most prerogative powers are exercised not by the monarch personally, but by ministers acting on his or her behalf; examples such as the power to regulate the civil service and the power to issue passports. Some major powers are exercised nominally by the monarch herself, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister and  Cabinet, and according to  constitutional convention. An example is the power to dissolve Parliament. According to a parliamentary report, \"The Crown cannot invent new prerogative powers\".It has long been established in the uncodified  Constitution of the United Kingdom that political power is ultimately exercised by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, of which the Sovereign is a non-partisan component, along with the House of Lords and the House of Commons, and by the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Thus, as the modern British monarchy is a constitutional one, the Sovereign\\'s role is in practice limited to non-partisan functions (such as being the  fount of honour). This role has been recognised since the 19th century;  Walter Bagehot identified the monarchy as the \"dignified part\" rather than the \"efficient part\" of government in The English Constitution (1867). In practice, political power is exercised today through Parliament and by the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The sovereign also holds the title of  Supreme Governor of the  established Church of England, although in practice the spiritual leadership of the Church is the responsibility of the Archbishop of Canterbury.The present sovereign is Queen Elizabeth II, who has reigned since  February 6,  1952.

Springsteen has frequently recorded and toured with the  E Street Band, in addition to recording and performing as a solo artist and with other musicians. An heir to Elvis Presley,  Woody Guthrie,  Pete Seeger,  Eddie Cochran and Bob Dylan, but also influenced by early 1960s rock and R&B, Springsteen is most widely known for his brand of  heartland rock infused with  pop hooks, poetic lyrics, and  Americana sentiments centered around his native  New Jersey.His eloquence in expressing ordinary, everyday problems has earned him numerous awards, including several  Grammy Awards, an  Academy Award, and induction into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, along with a very large, devoted, and long-lasting  fan base. His most famous albums,  Born to Run and  Born in the U.S.A., epitomize his penchant for finding grandeur in the struggles of daily life.Springsteen's lyrics often concern men and women struggling to make ends meet. He has gradually become identified with  progressive politics. Springsteen is also noted for his support of various relief and rebuilding efforts in New Jersey and elsewhere and for his response to the September 11, 2001 attacks, on which his album  The Rising reflects.Springsteen's recordings have tended to alternate between commercially accessible rock albums and somber folk-oriented works. Much of Springsteen's iconic status in America as well as his popularity abroad stems from his concert performances—marathon shows, up to four hours in length, in which he and the E Street Band energetically perform intense ballads, rousing anthems, and party rock and roll songs, with Springsteen telling long whimsical or deeply emotional stories in between.Springsteen has long had the nickname The Boss, a term which he was initially reported to dislike but now seems to have come to terms with — he sometimes jokingly refers to himself as such on stage.\",\n",

There are many ways of setting the bristle in the brush: the most common is the staple or anchor set brush, in which the filament is forced with a staple by the middle into a hole with a special driver and held there by the pressure against the walls of the hole and the portions of the staple nailed to the bottom of the hole. The staple can be substituted with a kind of anchor, which is a piece of rectangular profile wire that, instead of nailing itself to the bottom of hole, is anchored to the wall of the hole, like in most toothbrushes. Another way to set the bristles to the surface can be found in the fused brush, in which instead of being inserted into a hole, a plastic fibre is welded to another plastic surface, giving the additional advantage of optionally using different diameters of tufts in the same brush, and a considerably thinner surface (sometimes the bristles can be set this way to the outer surface of a plastic bottle).See below for some other common kinds of brushes.',\n",

In most schemes, the theoretical possibility of a brute force attack is recognized, but it is set up in such a way that it would be computationally infeasible to carry out. Accordingly, one definition of \"breaking\" a cryptographic scheme is to find a method faster than a brute force attack.The selection of an appropriate  key length depends on the practical feasibility of performing a brute force attack. By  obfuscating the data to be encoded, brute force attacks are made less effective as it is more difficult to determine when one has succeeded in breaking the code.',\n",

Despite its name, this is not actually a  canyon, but rather a giant natural  amphitheater created by  erosion along the eastern side of the  Paunsaugunt Plateau. Bryce is distinctive due to its unique geological structures, called  hoodoos, formed from wind, water, and ice erosion of the river and lakebed  sedimentary rocks. The red, orange and white colors of the  rocks provide spectacular views.Bryce is at a much higher elevation than nearby Zion National Park and the Grand Canyon. The rim at Bryce varies from 8,000 to 9,000 feet (2400 to 2700 m), whereas the south rim of the Grand Canyon sits at 7,000 feet (2100 m) above  sea level. The area therefore has a very different ecology and climate, and thus offers a contrast for visitors to the region (who often visit all three parks in a single vacation).The canyon area was settled by Mormon pioneers in the 1850s and was named after  Ebenezer Bryce, who homesteaded in the area in 1875. The area around Bryce Canyon became a United States national monument in 1924 and was designated as a national park in 1928. The park covers 56 mi² (145 km²). The park receives relatively few visitors compared to Zion Canyon and the Grand Canyon, largely due to its remote location.

Since then it has gone through a variety of changes, becoming the state capital of Romania in 1862 and steadily consolidating its position as the centre of the Romanian mass media, culture and arts. Its eclectic architecture is a mix of historical, interbellum, Communist-era, and modern. In the period between the two World Wars, the city\\'s elegant architecture and the sophistication of its elite earned Bucharest the nickname of the \"Paris of the East\" or \"Little Paris\" (Micul Paris).

The Palace is a setting for state occasions and royal entertaining, a base for many officially visiting  Heads of State, and a major tourist attraction. It has been a rallying point for British people at times of national rejoicing, crisis or grief. \"Buckingham Palace\" or simply \"The Palace\" commonly refers to the source of Press statements issued by the offices of the  Royal Household.In the Middle Ages, Buckingham Palace\\'s site formed part of the Manor of Ebury. It had several royal owners from Edward the Confessor onwards and was also the object of much property speculation. (A loophole in the lease of Charles I allowed the area to revert back to royal hands in the 18th century.) Precursors of Buckingham Palace were Blake House, Goring House, and Arlington House.Originally known as Buckingham House, the building forming the core of today\\'s palace was a large  townhouse built for the  Duke of Buckingham in 1703 and acquired by King George III in 1762 as a private  residence. It was enlarged over the next 75 years, principally by  architects  John Nash and  Edward Blore, forming three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace finally became the official royal palace of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837. The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th century, when the large east wing facing  The Mall was added, and the former State entrance,  Marble Arch, was removed to its present position near  Speakers\\' Corner in Hyde Park. The east front was refaced in  Portland stone in 1913 as a backdrop to the  Victoria Memorial, creating the present-day public face of Buckingham Palace, including the famous balcony.The original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which still survive, included widespread use of brightly coloured  scagliola and blue and pink  lapis, on the advice of Sir  Charles Long. King Edward VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a  Belle epoque cream and gold colour scheme. Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese  regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the  Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from  Carlton House following the death of King George IV. The  Buckingham Palace Gardens are the largest private gardens in London, originally landscaped by  Capability Brown, but redesigned by  William Townsend Aiton of  Kew Gardens and John Nash.

He traveled the world giving lectures, and received numerous honorary doctorates. Most of his inventions, however, never made it into production, and he was strongly criticized in most of the fields that he tried to influence (such as architecture), or simply dismissed as a hopeless  utopian.

       " 'Buddha': 'In Buddhism, a buddha (Sanskrit बुद्ध) is any being who has become fully awakened (enlightened), has permanently overcome  greed,  hate, and  ignorance, and has achieved complete liberation from  suffering. Buddhists consider  enlightenment, also called  nirvana (Pali nibbana), the highest form of  happiness. Siddhartha Gautama (Pali Siddhattha Gautama), the historical founder of Buddhism, is often referred to as \"Buddha\", or \"the Buddha\". The word buddha literally means \"awakened\" or \"that which has become aware\". It is the  past participle of the Sanskrit root budh, meaning \"to awaken\", \"to know\", or \"to become aware\". Buddha as a title may be translated as \"The Awakened One\".The teachings of the Buddha are called the  Dharma (Pali: Dhamma). The Dharma teaches that all suffering arises from attachment, particularly attachment to worldly desires. Nirvana is attained by learning to achieve peace of mind by overcoming the attachment one has to various material objects as well as emotional desires such as  envy,  greed,  lust, and  pride.A common misconception views Buddha as the Buddhist counterpart to “God”; Buddhism, however, is non-theistic (i.e., in general it does not teach the existence of a supreme creator god (see  God in Buddhism) or depend on any supreme being for enlightenment; Buddha is a guide and teacher who points the way to nirvana). The commonly accepted definition of the term \"God\" describes a being that not only rules but actually created the universe (see  origin belief). Such ideas and concepts are disputed by Buddha and Buddhists in many Buddhist discourses. In Buddhism, the supreme origin and creator of the universe is not a god, but  Avidya (ignorance). Buddhists try to dispel this darkness through constant practice, compassion and wisdom (known as  prajna).In the Pali Canon, the term \\'buddha\\' refers to anyone who has become enlightened (i.e., awakened to the truth, or  Dharma) on their own, without a teacher to point out the  Dharma, in a time when the teachings on the  Four Noble Truths or the  Eightfold Path do not exist in the world.Generally, Buddhists do not consider  Siddhartha Gautama to have been the only buddha. The Pali Canon refers to Gautama Buddha at least once as the 28th Buddha (see  List of the 28 Buddhas). A common Buddhist belief is that the next Buddha will be one named  Maitreya (Pali: Metteyya).Buddhism teaches that anyone can become awakened and experience  nirvana.  Theravada Buddhism teaches that one doesn\\'t need to become a Buddha to become awakened and experience nirvana, since an  Arahant (Sanskrit: Arhat) also has those qualities. Some Buddhist texts (e.g., the  Lotus Sutra) imply that all beings will become Buddhas at some point in time.',\n",

Around the 1st century CE an  iconic period emerged lasting to this day which represents the Buddha in human form.Buddhist art followed believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through  Central Asia and into  Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as  Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of Hindu art, until Buddhism nearly disappeared in India around the 10th century due in part to the vigorous expansion of Islam alongside Hinduism.',\n",

Butter is used as a  spread and a  condiment, as well as in  cooking applications such as baking, sauce making, and frying. As a result, butter is consumed daily in many parts of the world. Butter consists of  butterfat surrounding minuscule droplets consisting mostly of water and milk proteins. The most common form of butter is made from cows\\' milk, but can also be made from the milk of other mammals, including  sheep, goats, buffalo, and yaks. Salt,  flavorings, or  preservatives are sometimes added to butter.  Rendering butter produces  clarified butter or  ghee, which is almost entirely butterfat.When  refrigerated, butter remains a solid, but softens to a spreadable consistency at  room temperature, and melts to a thin liquid consistency at 32–35\\xa0°C (90–95\\xa0°F). Butter generally has a pale  yellow color, but varies from deep yellow to nearly white. The colour of the butter depends on the animal\\'s feed and is sometimes manipulated with  food colorings, most commonly  annatto or  carotene.The term \"butter\" is used in the names of products made from  puréed nuts or peanuts, such as  peanut butter. It is also used in the names of fruit products, such as  apple butter. Other  fats solid at room temperature are also known as \"butters\"; examples include  cocoa butter and  shea butter. In general use, the term \"butter\", unqualified, almost always refers to the dairy product. The word butter, in the English language, derives (via  Germanic languages) from the Latin butyrum, borrowed from the  Greek boutyron. This may have been a construction meaning \"cow-cheese\" (bous \"ox, cow\" + tyros \"cheese\"), or the word may have been borrowed from another language, possibly  Scythian. The root word persists in the  butyric acid found in  rancid butter and other rancid dairy products.',\n",

       " 'CPU_cache': \"A CPU cache is a  cache used by the central processing unit of a computer to reduce the average time to access  memory. The cache is a smaller, faster memory which stores copies of the data from the most frequently used  main memory locations. As long as most memory accesses are to cached memory locations, the average  latency of memory accesses will be closer to the cache latency than to the latency of main memory.The diagram to the right shows two memories. Each location in each memory has a datum (a cache line), which in different designs ranges in size from 8 to 512  bytes. The size of the cache line is usually larger than the size of the usual access requested by a CPU instruction, which ranges from 1 to 16 bytes. Each location in each memory also has an index, which is a unique number used to refer to that location. The index for a location in main memory is called an  address. Each location in the cache has a tag, which contains the index of the datum in main memory which has been cached. In a CPU's data cache, these entries are called cache lines or cache blocks.When the processor wishes to read or write a location in main memory, it first checks whether that memory location is in the cache. This is accomplished by comparing the address of the memory location to all tags in the cache that might contain that address. If the processor finds that the memory location is in the cache, we say that a cache hit has occurred, otherwise we speak of a cache miss. In the case of a cache hit, the processor immediately reads or writes the data in the cache line. The proportion of accesses that result in a cache hit is known as the hit rate, and is a measure of the effectiveness of the cache.In the case of a cache miss, most caches allocate a new entry, which comprises the tag just missed and a copy of the data from memory. The reference can then be applied to the new entry just as in the case of a hit. Misses are slow because they require the data to be transferred from main memory. This transfer incurs a delay since main memory is much slower than cache memory.\",\n",

The first is  differential calculus, which is concerned with the instantaneous, as opposed to average, rate of change of a quantity. This can be illustrated by the  slope of a function\\'s graph at a particular point. The second is  integral calculus, which studies the accumulation of infinitely small quantities, summing to areas under a  curve, linear  distance travelled, or  volume displaced. These two processes act inversely to each other, as shown by the  fundamental theorem of calculus.Differential calculus typically provides a way to derive the acceleration and  velocity of a body at a particular moment while integral calculus problems are used to compute  areas and  volumes, to find the amount of a liquid pumped by a pump with a set power input but varying conditions of pumping losses and pressure, or to find the amount of parking lot plowed by a snowplow of given power with varying rates of snowfall.In Europe, fundamental advances in calculus during the 17th and 18th century had a deep impact on the ensuing development of physics. Today, calculus is used in every branch of the physical sciences, in computer science, in statistics, and in engineering; in economics, business, and medicine; and as a general method whenever the goal is an  optimal solution to a problem that can be given in mathematical form.',\n",

The story of writing is one of aesthetic evolution framed within the technical skills, transmission speed(s) and materials limitations of a person, time and place (Diringer 1968: 441). A style of writing is described as a hand or alphabet (Johnston 1909: Plate 6).Calligraphy ranges from functional hand lettered inscriptions and designs to fine art pieces where the abstract expression of the handwritten mark may or may not supersede the legibility of the letters (Mediavilla 1996). Classical calligraphy differs from  typography and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may create all of these;  characters are historically disciplined yet fluid and spontaneous, improvised at the moment of writing (Pott 2006 & 2005; Zapf 2007 & 2006).

To date, more than 30 million copies of the 18 Calvin and Hobbes books have been printed, and popular culture is still replete with  references to the strip.The strip is  vaguely set in the contemporary  Midwestern United States, on the outskirts of  suburbia, a location probably inspired by Watterson\\'s home town of  Chagrin Falls, Ohio. Calvin and Hobbes appear in most of the strips, though several focused instead upon Calvin\\'s family. The broad themes of the strip deal with Calvin\\'s flights of fantasy, his friendship with Hobbes, his misadventures, his views on a diverse range of political and cultural issues and his relationships and interactions with his parents, classmates, educators, and other members of society. A number of cartoons feature Calvin announcing the results of \"polls of household six-year-olds\" to his father, treating his father\\'s position as though it were an elected political office.The dual nature of Hobbes is also a recurring motif. Calvin sees Hobbes as alive, while other characters see him as a stuffed animal, a point discussed more fully in  Hobbes\\' main article.

Furthermore, as a federal statute, it had no application to provincial laws. This motivated some within government to improve rights protections in Canada. The movement for  human rights and freedoms that emerged after World War II also wanted to entrench the principles enunciated in the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Hence, the Government of  Prime Minister  Pierre Trudeau enacted the Charter in 1982.One of the most notable effects of the adoption of the Charter was to greatly expand the scope of  judicial review, because the Charter is more explicit with respect to the guarantee of rights and the role of judges in enforcing them than was the Bill of Rights. The  courts, when confronted with violations of Charter rights, have struck down unconstitutional federal and provincial statutes and regulations or parts of statutes and regulations, as they did when  Canadian case law was primarily concerned with resolving issues of  federalism. However, the Charter granted new powers to the courts to enforce remedies that are more creative and to exclude more evidence in trials. These powers are greater than what was typical under the  common law and under a system of government that, influenced by Canada's mother country the United Kingdom, was based upon  Parliamentary supremacy. As a result, the Charter has attracted both broad support from a majority of the Canadian electorate and criticisms by opponents of increased  judicial power. The Charter only applies to government laws and actions (including the laws and actions of federal, provincial, and municipal governments and public school boards), and to the common law, not to private activity.\",\n",

The House of Commons is a democratically elected body, consisting of  308 members, who are known as Members of Parliament. Members are elected for limited terms, holding office until Parliament is dissolved (a maximum of five years). Each member is elected by, and represents, one of the country\\'s  electoral districts, which are colloquially known as  ridings.The House of Commons was established in 1867, when the  British North America Act 1867 created the  Dominion of Canada, and was modelled on the British House of Commons. The  \"lower\" of the two houses making up the parliament, the House of Commons in practice holds far more power than the  upper house, the Senate. Although the approval of both Houses is necessary for legislation, the Senate very rarely rejects bills passed by the Commons (though the Senate does occasionally amend bills). Moreover, the Government of Canada is responsible solely to the House of Commons. The  Prime Minister stays in office only as long as he or she retains the support of the Lower House.It is widely thought that \"Commons\" is a shortening of the word \"commoners\". However, the term derives from the  Anglo-Norman word communes, referring to the geographic and collective \"communities\" of their parliamentary representatives and not the third estate, the commonality.

It was Canada's first  transcontinental railway. Now primarily a  freight railway, the CPR was for two decades the only practical means of long distance  passenger transport in most regions of Canada, and was instrumental in the  settlement and  development of  Western Canada. Its primary passenger services were eliminated in 1986 after being assumed by  VIA Rail Canada in 1978.

The number of seats for  Newfoundland and Labrador, the  Northwest Territories,  Yukon, and  Nunavut are assigned apart from these regional divisions. Senators serve until they reach the age of seventy-five.The Senate is referred to as the \" upper house\" of Parliament, and the House of Commons is referred to as the \" lower house\". This does not, however, imply the Senate is more powerful than the House of Commons. Indeed, as a matter of practice and custom, the Commons is by far the dominant chamber. Although the approval of both Houses is necessary for legislation, the Senate rarely rejects  bills passed by the democratically-elected Commons. Moreover, the  Government of Canada is responsible solely to the House of Commons; the Prime Minister stays in office only as long as he or she retains the support of the lower house. The Senate does not exercise any such control. Although legislation can normally be introduced in either house, the majority of government bills originate in the House of Commons. Under the constitution,  money bills must always originate in the lower house.The chamber in which the Senate sits is sometimes called the red chamber, due to the lavish decoration and design, and the red cloth that adorns the chamber (and notably, the Throne); it is a stark contrast to the green and more modest style of the House of Commons. This is inherited from the British Houses of Parliament, where the Lords chamber is a lavish room with red benches, whereas the Commons chamber is a sparsely-decorated room with green benches.',\n",

       " 'Cancer': 'Cancer is a class of  diseases or disorders characterized by uncontrolled  division of cells and the ability of these cells to invade other  tissues, either by direct growth into adjacent tissue through invasion or by implantation into distant sites by  metastasis. Metastasis is defined as the stage in which cancer cells are transported through the  bloodstream or  lymphatic system. Cancer may affect people at all ages, but risk tends to increase with age, due to the fact that  DNA damage becomes more apparent in  aging DNA. It is one of the principal causes of death in  developed countries.There are many types of cancer. Severity of symptoms depends on the site and character of the malignancy and whether there is metastasis. A definitive diagnosis usually requires the  histologic examination of tissue by a  pathologist. This tissue is obtained by  biopsy or  surgery. Most cancers can be treated and some cured, depending on the specific type, location, and  stage. Once diagnosed, cancer is usually treated with a combination of  surgery,  chemotherapy and  radiotherapy. As research develops, treatments are becoming more specific for the type of cancer pathology. Drugs that target specific cancers already exist for several cancers. If untreated, cancers may eventually cause illness and  death, though this is not always the case.The unregulated growth that characterizes cancer is caused by damage to DNA, resulting in  mutations to  genes that encode for proteins controlling cell division. Many mutation events may be required to transform a normal cell into a malignant cell. These mutations can be caused by chemicals or physical agents called  carcinogens, by close exposure to radioactive materials, or by certain viruses that can insert their DNA into the human genome. Mutations occur spontaneously, and may be passed down from one generation to the next as a result of mutations within  germ lines.Many forms of cancer are associated with exposure to  environmental factors such as  tobacco smoke,  radiation,  alcohol, and certain viruses. While some of these risk factors can be avoided or reduced, there is no known way to entirely avoid the disease.',\n",

It is a member of the  genus  Bufo, which includes hundreds of different true toad  species in different habitats throughout the world. The Cane Toad is a prolific breeder; females lay single-clump  spawns with large numbers of  eggs. Its reproductive success is partly due to opportunistic feeding: it has a diet, unusual among Anurans, of both dead and living matter. Adults average 10 to 15 centimetres (4–6\\xa0in) in length; the largest recorded specimen weighed 2.65 kilograms (5.84\\xa0lb) and measured 38 centimetres (15\\xa0in) from snout to vent.The Cane Toad has large  poison  glands, and adults and  tadpoles are highly toxic to most animals if ingested. Because of its voracious appetite, the Cane Toad has been introduced to many regions of the Pacific and the  Caribbean islands as a method of agricultural  pest control, notably in the case of Australia in 1935, and derives its common name from its use against  sugar cane pests. The Cane Toad itself is now considered a pest in many of its introduced regions, as its toxic skin kills many native predators when ingested.',\n",

In  2000, possible specimens were found in captivity in Russia and brought to South Africa for breeding.  There is much confusion between Cape lions and other dark-coloured long-maned captive lions. Lions in captivity today have been bred and cross-bred from lions captured in Africa long ago, with examples from all of these \\'subspecies\\'.

However, nowadays it is known that various extrinsic factors, including the ambient temperature, influence the colour and size of a lion’s mane. Results of  mitochondrial DNA research published in  2006 do not support the ‘‘distinctness’’ of the Cape lion.

They shelter in caves or dens they dig themselves. Female cape porcupines are the biggest rodents in southern Africa, weighing more than 30  kilograms (66 pounds) and growing more than two feet long. The cape porcupine is covered in bristly quills varying in thickness. The longest spines grow as long as the animal\\'s body and quills only eight inches shorter. On its tail, the spines are hollow to make a rattling sound to scare away  predators. When attacked, the porcupine freezes.If cornered, it turns vicious and charges to stab its attacker with its quills.

In  unitary states, \"administrative centre\" or other similar terms are typically used. For example, the seat of government in a state of the United States of America is usually called its \"capital\", but the main city in a region of England is usually not. At lower administrative subdivisions, terms such as  county town,  county seat, or  borough seat are usually used.Historically, the major economic centre of a state or region often becomes the focal point of political power, and becomes a capital through conquest or amalgamation. This was the case for London and Moscow. The capital naturally attracts the politically motivated and those whose skills are needed for efficient administration of government such as  lawyers,  journalists, and  public policy researchers. A capital that is the prime economic, cultural, or intellectual centre is sometimes referred to as a  primate city. Such is certainly the case with London and Buenos Aires among national capitals, and  Irkutsk or Salt Lake City in their respective state or province.Capitals are sometimes sited to discourage further growth in an existing major city. Brasília was planted in Brazil\\'s interior because the old capital, Rio de Janeiro, along with all of Southeastern Brazil, was considered already crowded. The government of South Korea announced in 2004 it would move its capital from Seoul to  Yeongi-Gongju — even though the word Seoul itself means \"capital\" in the  Korean language.The convergence of political and economic or cultural power is by no means universal. Traditional capitals may be economically eclipsed by provincial rivals, as occurred with  Nanjing by Shanghai. The decline of a dynasty or culture could mean the extinction of its capital city as well, as occurred with  Babylon and  Cahokia.

He is commonly placed in the Baroque school, of which he was the first great representative.Even in his own lifetime Caravaggio was considered enigmatic, fascinating, and dangerous. He burst upon the Rome art scene in 1600, and thereafter never lacked for commissions or patrons, yet handled his success atrociously. An early published notice on him, dating from 1604 and describing his lifestyle some three years previously, tells how \"after a fortnight\\'s work he will swagger about for a month or two with a sword at his side and a servant following him, from one ball-court to the next, ever ready to engage in a fight or an argument, so that it is most awkward to get along with him.\" In  1606 he killed a young man in a brawl and fled from Rome with a price on his head. In Malta in  1608 he was involved in another brawl, and yet another in Naples in 1609, possibly a deliberate attempt on his life by unidentified enemies. By the next year, after a career of little more than a decade, he was dead.Huge new churches and palazzi were being built in Rome in the decades of the late 16th and early 17th centuries, and paintings were needed to fill them. The  Counter-Reformation Church searched for authentic religious art with which to counter the threat of Protestantism, and for this task the artificial conventions of  Mannerism, which had ruled art for almost a century, no longer seemed adequate. Caravaggio\\'s novelty was a radical  naturalism which combined close physical observation with a dramatic, even theatrical, approach to  chiaroscuro, the use of light and shadow. In Caravaggio\\'s hands this new style was the vehicle for authentic and moving spirituality.Famous and extremely influential while he lived, Caravaggio was almost entirely forgotten in the centuries after his death, and it was only in the 20th century that his importance to the development of Western art was rediscovered. Yet despite this his influence on the common style which eventually emerged from the ruins of Mannerism, the new Baroque, was profound.

       " 'Carl_G._Fisher': 'Carl Graham Fisher ( January 12,  1874 - July 15,  1939) was an American  entrepreneur. Despite having severe  astigmatism, he became a seemingly tireless pioneer and promoter of the  automotive, auto racing, and  real estate development industries.Regarded as a promotional genius for most of his life, he was a bicycle enthusiast and became involved in bicycle and later auto racing. After being injured in stunts, he helped develop paved racetracks and roadways. An  Indiana native, Fisher helped organize the  Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and operated what is believed to be the first  automobile dealership in the United States.In  1913, Fisher conceived and helped develop the  Lincoln Highway, the first road across America. He followed that in  1914 with the conception of the  Dixie Highway, which first led from Indianapolis, and eventually extended in several northern branches from the Mid-West U.S. at the Canadian borders to southern mainland Florida. Under his leadership, the initial portion was completed within a single year, and he led an automobile caravan to Florida from Indiana.At the south end of the Dixie Highway in Miami, Florida, Fisher became involved in the successful  real estate development of the new resort city of  Miami Beach, built on a largely unpopulated  barrier island and reached by the new  Collins Bridge across  Biscayne Bay directly at the terminus of the Dixie Highway. Fisher was one of the best known and active promoters of the  Florida land boom of the 1920s. By 1926, he was worth an estimated $100 million, and redirected his promotional efforts when the Florida real estate market bubble burst after 1925. His final major project, cut short by the  Great Depression, was a \"Miami Beach of the north\" at  Montauk, located at the eastern tip of  Long Island,  New York.His fortune was lost in the  Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression in the United States which followed shortly thereafter. He found himself living in a small cottage in Miami Beach, doing minor work for old friends. Nevertheless, years after his fortune had been lost, at the end of his career, he took on one more project, albeit more modest than many of his past ventures, and built the famous  Caribbean Club on  Key Largo, intended as a \"poor man\\'s retreat.\"Although he had lost his fortune and late in life considered himself a failure, Fisher is widely regarded as a very successful man in the long view of his life. He was inducted into the  Automotive Hall of Fame in 1971. In a 1998 study judged by a panel of 56 historians, writers, and others, Carl G. Fisher was named one of the 50 Most Influential People in the history of the State of Florida by The Ledger newspaper.

       " 'Casimir_effect': 'In physics, the Casimir effect is a physical  force exerted between separate objects, which is due to neither charge, gravity, nor the exchange of  particles, but instead is due to  resonance of  all-pervasive energy fields in the intervening space between the objects. This is sometimes described in terms of  virtual particles interacting with the objects, due to the mathematical form of one possible way of calculating the strength of the effect. Since the strength of the force falls off rapidly with distance it is only measurable when the distance between the objects is extremely small. On a submicron scale, this force becomes so strong that it becomes the dominant force between uncharged conductors.Dutch  physicist  Hendrik B. G. Casimir first proposed the existence of the force, and he formulated an experiment to detect it in  1948 while participating in research at  Philips Research Labs. The classic form of his experiment used a pair of uncharged parallel metal plates in a vacuum, and successfully demonstrated the force to within 15% of the value he had predicted according to his theory.The  van der Waals force between a pair of neutral atoms is a similar effect. In modern  theoretical physics, the Casimir effect plays an important role in the  chiral bag model of the  nucleon, and in  applied physics, it is becoming of increasing importance in development of the ever-smaller, miniaturised components of emerging  micro- and  nano- technologies.',\n",

A skilled  predator, the cat is known to hunt over 1,000 species for food. Intelligent, the cat can can be trained to obey simple commands, and has been known to teach itself to manipulate simple mechanisms (see  cat intelligence).The  trinomial name of the domestic cat is Felis silvestris catus. Its closest pre-domesticated ancestor is believed to be the  African wild cat, Felis silvestris lybica. Humans have developed  several dozen breeds of cat, in a variety of colours.Cats have lived in close association with humans for at least 9,500 years,. Legends and myths about the cat exist in many cultures, from the  ancient Egyptians and  Chinese to the Vikings. They have been both revered and vilified by different cultures.Cats use more than one hundred vocalizations and types of body language for communication, including mewing (\"meow\" or \"miaou\"),  purring,  hissing,  growling,  chirping,  clicking, and grunting. Cats have even been observed mimicking the calls of birds.Like horses and other domesticated animals, cats can sometimes become  feral, living effectively in the wild.  Feral cats will often form small  feral cat colonies. Animal welfare organizations note that few abandoned cats are able to survive long enough to become feral, most being killed by vehicles, or succumbing to starvation, predators, exposure, or disease.',\n",

       " 'Cataract': 'A cataract is an  opacity that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its envelope. Early on in the development of senile cataract the power of the crystaline lens may be increased, causing  myopia, and the gradual yellowing and opacification of the lens may reduce the perception of blue colours. Cataracts typically progress slowly to cause  vision loss and are potentially  blinding if untreated. Moreover, with time the cataract cortex liquefies to form a milky white fluid in a Morgagnian Cataract, and can cause severe inflammation if the lens capsule ruptures and leaks. Untreated, the cataract can cause  phacomorphic glaucoma. Very advanced cataracts with weak zonules are liable to dislocation anteriorly or posteriorly. Such spontaneous posterior dislocations (akin to the earliest surgical procedure of couching) in ancient times were regarded as a blessing from the heavens, because it restored some perception of light in the bilaterally affected patients.Cataract derives from the Latin cataracta meaning \"waterfall\" and the  Greek kataraktes and katarrhaktes, from katarassein meaning \"to dash down\" (kata-, \"down\"; arassein, \"to strike, dash\"). As rapidly running water turns white, the term may later have been used metaphorically to describe the similar appearance of mature ocular opacities. In Latin, cataracta had the alternate meaning, \" portcullis\", so it is also possible that the name came about through the sense of \"obstruction\".',\n",

In some countries, such as India, they are subject to religious ceremonies and respect.

These were Bos taurus, the European cattle, including similar types from Africa and Asia; Bos indicus, the  zebu; and the extinct Bos primigenius, the  aurochs. The aurochs is ancestral to both zebu and European cattle. More recently these three have increasingly been grouped as one species, sometimes using the names Bos primigenius taurus, Bos primigenius indicus and Bos primigenius primigenius. Complicating the matter is the ability of cattle to interbreed with other closely related species. Hybrid individuals and even breeds exist, not only between European cattle and zebu but also with yaks,  banteng, gaur, and bison, a cross-genera hybrid. For example, genetic testing of the Dwarf Lulu breed, the only humpless \"Bos taurus-type\" cattle in Nepal, found them to be a mix of European cattle, zebu and yak.

It borders Chad in the north, Sudan on the east, the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the south, and Cameroon on the west. Most of the CAR consists of Sudano-Guinean savannas but it also includes a  Sahelo-Sudanese zone in the north and an Equatorial forest zone in the south. Two thirds of the country lies in the basins of the  Ubangi river, which flows south into the Congo River, while the remaining third lies in the basin of the  Shari river, which flows north into Lake Chad. Since most of the territory is located in the Ubangi and Shari river basins, the French called the colony it carved out in this region  Ubangi-Shari, or  Oubangui-Chari in French. This French colony of Ubangi-Shari became a semi-autonomous territory of the  French Community in 1958 and then an independent nation on 13 August 1960. For over three decades since independence the CAR was ruled by presidents who were not chosen in truly democratic elections or who took power by force. Local discontent was eventually reinforced by international pressure, following the end of the cold war. The first fair democratic elections were held in  1993 with resources provided by the country's donors and help from the UN Office for Electoral Affairs. They brought  Ange-Félix Patassé to power, but President Patassé lost popular support and was  overthrown by General  François Bozizé in  2003. General Bozizé won a  democratic election in  May 2005 and remains in power today.

       " 'Central_processing_unit': 'A central processing unit (CPU), or sometimes simply processor, is the component in a  digital computer that interprets  instructions and processes  data contained in computer programs. CPUs provide the fundamental digital computer trait of programmability, and are one of the necessary components found in computers of any era, along with  primary storage and  input/output facilities. A CPU that is manufactured using integrated circuits is known as a  microprocessor. Since the mid-1970s, single-chip microprocessors have almost totally replaced all other types of CPUs, and today the term \"CPU\" is usually applied to some type of microprocessor.The phrase \"central processing unit\" is a description of a certain class of logic machines that can execute complex  computer programs. This broad definition can easily be applied to many early computers that existed long before the term \"CPU\" ever came into widespread usage. However, the term itself and its initialism have been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s . The form, design and implementation of CPUs have changed dramatically since the earliest examples, but their fundamental operation has remained much the same.Early CPUs were custom-designed as a part of a larger, usually one-of-a-kind, computer. However, this costly method of designing custom CPUs for a particular application has largely given way to the development of inexpensive and standardized classes of processors that are suited for one or many purposes. This standardization trend generally began in the era of discrete  transistor  mainframes and  minicomputers and has rapidly accelerated with the popularization of the integrated circuit (IC). The IC has allowed increasingly complex CPUs to be designed and manufactured in very small spaces (on the order of  millimeters). Both the miniaturization and standardization of CPUs have increased the presence of these digital devices in modern life far beyond the limited application of dedicated computing machines. Modern microprocessors appear in everything from automobiles to  cell phones to children\\'s toys.',\n",

This theory is now considered a cornerstone of biology, and has significantly affected other disciplines such as philosophy, psychology and anthropology.Darwin developed his interest in natural history while studying first medicine, then  theology, at university. His  five-year voyage on the  Beagle brought him eminence as a geologist whose work supported  Charles Lyell\\'s  uniformitarian theory of geology, and fame as a popular author. The wildlife distribution he saw on the voyage led him to investigate the  transmutation of species and in 1838 he conceived his theory of natural selection. He had seen others attacked for such \" heretical\" ideas and confided only in his closest friends while carrying out extensive research so that anticipated objections were fully covered. However,  Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay describing a similar theory in 1858, forcing early joint  publication of the theory.His 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life (usually abbreviated to The Origin of Species) established evolution by  common descent as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature. He continued his research and wrote a series of books on plants and animals, including humankind, notably  The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex and  The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals.In recognition of Darwin\\'s pre-eminence, he was buried in Westminster Abbey, close to  John Herschel and Isaac Newton.',\n",

       " 'Charles_II_of_England': 'Charles II ( 29 May  1630 –  6 February  1685) was the  King of England,  King of Scots, and  King of Ireland from  30 January  1649 ( de jure) or  29 May  1660 ( de facto) until his death. His father Charles I had been executed in 1649, following the  English Civil War; the monarchy was then abolished and  England, and subsequently  Scotland and  Ireland became a united republic under Oliver Cromwell, the  Lord Protector (see  Commonwealth of England and  The Protectorate), albeit with Scotland and Ireland under military occupation and de facto  martial law. In 1660, shortly after Cromwell\\'s death, the monarchy was  restored under Charles II. He was popularly known as the \"Merry Monarch\" in reference to the liveliness and  hedonism of his court.The exact date at which Charles became King is vague due to the uncertain political situation of the time. His father was executed on  30 January  1649, making him in theory King Charles II from that moment. He was immediately proclaimed King in Scotland on  5 February and Jersey on  16 February  1649—but also recognised in a few British colonies (especially the  Colony and Dominion of Virginia). In Scotland Charles was for some time King in title only. It took two years of negotiation with the Presbyterians before he was finally crowned King of Scots in Scone on  1 January  1651. However, his reign there was shortlived as he was soon driven out by the republican armies, led by Oliver Cromwell. His coronation in England would not be until after Cromwell\\'s death and the monarchy\\'s restoration in May 1660, Charles spending most of the intervening time exiled in France.Much like his father, Charles II struggled for most of his life in his relations with Parliament, although the tensions between the two never reached the same levels of hostility. He was only able to achieve true success towards the end of his reign, by dispensing with Parliament and ruling alone. Unlike his father\\'s however, this policy did not lead to widespread popular opposition, as he avoided the imposition of any new taxes, thanks in part to money he received as a result of his close relationship with the French king,  Louis XIV. The principal conflicts of his reign revolved around a number of interlinked issues in domestic and foreign policy, most of which were related to the conflict between Protestants and Catholics then raging across Europe. As a consequence of this, Charles\\' reign was racked by political factions and intrigue, and it was at this time that the  Whig and  Tory  political parties first developed.He famously fathered numerous  illegitimate children, of whom he acknowledged fourteen, but no  legitimate children who lived. Charles was also a  patron of the arts, and he and his court were largely responsible for the revival of public drama and music, after their virtual prohibition under the earlier  Protectorate. Some historians, such as Maurice Ashley, believe that Charles was secretly a Roman Catholic for much of his life like his brother James while others, such as  Antonia Fraser, disagree. All that is known for certain is that he had converted to Roman Catholicism by the time of his death.',\n",

He famously engaged in a struggle for power with the  Parliament of England. As he was an advocate of the  Divine Right of Kings, many in England feared that he was attempting to gain  absolute power. There was widespread opposition to many of his actions, especially the levying of  taxes without Parliament's consent.Religious conflicts permeated Charles' reign. He married a Catholic princess,  Henrietta Maria, over the objections of Parliament and public opinion. Charles further allied himself with controversial religious figures, including the  ecclesiastic  Richard Montagu, and  William Laud, whom Charles appointed Archbishop of Canterbury. Laud did not bring changes to the liturgy of the Church of England, but he did endorse a stricter enforcement of the English Prayerbook, which included ceremonies that many Englishmen chose to omit. Many of Charles' subjects felt this brought the Church of England too close to Roman Catholicism. Charles' later attempts to force religious reforms upon Scotland led to the Bishops' Wars that weakened England and helped precipitate his downfall.The last years of Charles' reign were marked by the  English Civil War, in which he was opposed by the forces of Parliament—who challenged his attempts to augment his own power—and by  Puritans, who were hostile to his religious policies and apparent Catholic sympathy. The first Civil War (1642 - 1645) ended in defeat for Charles, after which the parliamentarians expected him to accept their demands for a constitutional monarchy. Instead, he remained defiant, provoking a second Civil War (1648 - 1649). This was considered unacceptable, and Charles was subsequently  tried,  convicted, and executed for  high treason. The monarchy was then abolished and a republic called the  Commonwealth of England was declared. Charles' son, Charles II, became King after  restoring the monarchy in 1660.Charles is also the only person to be  canonized by the Church of England since the English Reformation.\",\n",

After years of therapy Sumner returned to the Senate to help lead the Civil War. Sumner, who specialized in foreign affairs, was a leading exponent of abolishing slavery to weaken the Confederacy. Although he kept on good terms with Abraham Lincoln, he was a leader of the hard-line  Radical Republicans.As the Radical Republican leader in the Senate during  Reconstruction, 1865-1871, Sumner fought hard to provide equal civil and voting rights for the freedmen, and to block ex-Confederates from power. Sumner, teaming with House leader  Thaddeus Stevens defeated Andrew Johnson, and imposed their hard-line views on the South.

The power plant is located at  51°23′23″N, 30°5′58″E, near  Pripyat, Ukraine, at the time part of the Soviet Union. It is regarded as the worst  accident ever in the history of nuclear power. A plume of  radioactive fallout drifted over parts of the western Soviet Union,  Eastern and  Western Europe,  Scandinavia, the  UK, Ireland and eastern North America. Large areas of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia were badly contaminated, resulting in the evacuation and resettlement of over 336,000 people. About 60% of the radioactive fallout landed in Belarus, according to official post-Soviet data.The accident raised concerns about the  safety of the Soviet nuclear power industry, slowing its expansion for a number of years, while forcing the Soviet government to become less secretive. The now-independent countries of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus have been burdened with continuing and substantial  decontamination and health care costs of the Chernobyl accident. It is difficult to tally accurately the number of deaths caused by the events at Chernobyl, as the Soviet-era cover-up made it difficult to track down victims. Lists were incomplete, and Soviet authorities later forbade doctors to cite \"radiation\" on death certificates. Most of the expected long-term fatalities, especially those from cancer, have not yet actually occurred, and will be difficult or even impossible to attribute specifically to the accident. Dr Peter Boyle, director of the  International Agency for Research on Cancer, put the discussion of the figures into perspective: \"Tobacco smoking will cause several thousand times more cancers in the same (European) population.\" Estimates and figures vary widely. The 2005 report prepared by the Chernobyl Forum, led by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and World Health Organization (WHO), attributed 56 direct deaths (47 accident workers, and nine children with  thyroid cancer), and estimated that as many as 9,000 people among the approximately 6.6 million most highly exposed, may die from some form of cancer (one of the induced diseases). Nearly 20 years after the disaster, according to the Chernobyl Forum, no evidence of increases in the solid cancers and, possibly more significantly, none of the widely expected increases in  leukemia have been found in the population.',\n",

He was sponsored by the  Catholic Monarchs and eventually became an  admiral for the  Crown of Castile. His voyages across the Atlantic Ocean began a European effort at  exploration and  colonization of the  American continent. While history places great significance on his first voyage of 1492, he did not actually reach the mainland until his third voyage in 1498. Likewise, he was not the earliest European explorer to reach the Americas, as there are accounts of  European transatlantic contact prior to 1492. Nevertheless, Columbus' voyage came at a critical time of growing  national imperialism and  economic competition between  developing nation states seeking wealth from the establishment of  trade routes and  colonies. Therefore, the period before 1492 is known as  Pre-Columbian, and the anniversary of this event (vd.  Columbus Day) is celebrated throughout the Americas and in Spain and Italy. However, as the legacy of colonialism in the Americas is today viewed somewhat more negatively than in the past, Columbus has become a divisive figure.\",\n",

The term \" purple fringing\" is commonly used in photography, although not all purple fringing can be attributed to chromatic aberration.Longitudinal and lateral chromatic  aberration of a lens is seen as \"fringes\" of color around the image, because each colour in the  optical spectrum cannot be focused at a single common point on the optical axis.Since the  focal length f of a lens is dependent on the refractive index n, different wavelengths of light will be focused on different positions. Chromatic aberration can be both longitudinal, in that different wavelengths are focused at a different distance from the lens; and transverse or lateral, in that different wavelengths are focused at different positions in the focal plane (because the  magnification of the lens also varies with wavelength).',\n",
       " 'Chromatophore': 'Chromatophores are  pigment-containing and light-reflecting cells found in  amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans, and  cephalopods. They are largely responsible for generating skin and  eye colour in  cold-blooded animals and are generated in the  neural crest during  embryonic development. Mature chromatophores are grouped into subclasses based on their colour (more properly \" hue\") under white light: xanthophores (yellow), erythrophores (red), iridophores ( reflective /  iridescent), leucophores (white), melanophores (black/brown) and cyanophores (blue). The term can also refer to coloured, membrane associated vesicles found in some forms of  photosynthetic bacteria.Some species can rapidly change colour through mechanisms that translocate pigment and reorient reflective plates within chromatophores. This process, often used as a type of  camouflage, is called physiological colour change. Cephalopods such as  octopus have complex chromatophore organs controlled by muscles to achieve this, while vertebrates such as  chameleons generate a similar effect by  cell signaling. Such signals can be  hormones or  neurotransmitters and may be initiated by changes in mood, temperature, stress or visible changes in local environment.Unlike cold-blooded animals, mammals and birds have only one class of chromatophore-like cell type: the  melanocyte. The cold-blooded equivalent, melanophores, are studied by scientists to understand human disease and used as a tool in  drug discovery.',\n",

       " 'Civil_rights': 'Civil rights are the protections and privileges of personal power given to all citizens by law. Civil rights are distinguished from \"human rights\" or \" natural rights\", also called \"our God-given rights\". They are rights that are bestowed by  nations on those within their territorial boundaries, while natural or human rights are rights that many scholars claim should belong to all people. For example, the philosopher John Locke ( 1632– 1704) argued that the natural rights of life,  liberty and property should be converted into civil rights and protected by the  sovereign  state as an aspect of the  social contract. Others have argued that people acquire rights as an  inalienable gift from the deity or at a time of  nature before governments were formed.Laws guaranteeing civil rights may be written down, derived from  custom or implied. In the United States and most continental European countries, civil rights laws are most often written. Examples of civil rights and liberties include the right to get redress if injured by another, the right to privacy, the right of peaceful protest, the right to a fair investigation and trial if suspected of a crime, and more generally-based constitutional rights such as the right to vote, the right to personal freedom, the right to freedom of movement and the right of equal protection. As civilisations emerged and formalised through written constitutions, some of the more important civil rights were granted to  citizens. When those grants were later found inadequate,  civil rights movements emerged as the vehicle for claiming more  equal protection for all citizens and advocating new laws to restrict the effect of current discriminations.',\n",

To be \"civilised\" essentially meant being a townsman, governed by the constitution and legal statutes of that community. Roman  civil law was gathered together into a consolidated body of the “ Corpus Juris Civilis” in the  6th Century for  Emperor Justinian ( AD  483- AD  565). Justinian\\'s code was rediscovered and used by law professors at the first University established in Western Europe, at Bologna in the 11th century. From  1388 the word “civil” appeared in English, while “civilisation” as a “law which makes a criminal process civil,\" appeared in  1704, closely followed in  1722 with “civilisation” - meaning the opposite of “ barbarity” and coming probably from the French language.

(See Characteristics of the instrument.)Clarinets actually comprise a  family of instruments of differing sizes and pitches. It is the largest such instrument family, with more than two dozen types. Of these many are rare or obsolete, and music written for them is usually played on one of the more common size instruments. The unmodified word clarinet usually refers to the B♭ soprano, by far the most common clarinet.

These women were pioneers in the  record industry by being the first black voices recorded and also by spreading the  12-bar blues form through out the country. In terms of performing, they often wore elaborate outfits and sang of the injustices of their lives, bonding with their audience’s sorrows. Their schedules were grueling, staying on the road most of the time with tent shows in the summer and theatres during the winter. With the  crash of Wall Street in 1929, the popularity of the blues singers declined. Some went back home, took up jobs or moved to  Hollywood. In the  ‘60s with the blues revival, Sippie Wallace, Alberta Hunter, Edith Wilson and Victoria Spivey returned to the stage.Gertrude “Ma” Rainey, form  Georgia, was the “ Mother of the Blues,” and lived from 1886-1939. She was the first woman to incorporate blues into her act of show songs and  comedy. In 1902, she heard a woman singing about the man she’d lost, and quickly learned the song. From then on at each performance, she used it as her closing number calling it “the blues.” She recorded over 100 songs and wrote 24 of them herself. “Bessie (Smith and all the others who followed in time), wrote jazz historian Dan Morgenstern “learned their art and craft from Ma, directly or indirectly.” Young women followed Ma Rainey’s path in the tent show circuit, since black performers were not allowed to be in venues. Eventually most singers were booked on the T.O.B.A. (Theatre Owners Booking Association) circuit.Mamie Smith, “America’s First Lady of the Blues,” was the first black woman to record the blues in 1920.  Harlem  songwriter/music publisher, Perry Bradford, brought Smith by the Okeh studio to get his songs heard. Sophie Tucker was ill on the day of her session and Okeh allowed Smith to record. They recorded two non-blues songs but were brought back into the studio to record a blues song six months later. All of the recording band members claimed different titles for the song that became known as “Crazy Blues.” The song sold over 17,000 copies in its first month.

Born in  Lugdunum in  Gaul (modern-day Lyon, France), to  Drusus and  Antonia Minor, he was the first Roman Emperor to be born outside  Italy.Claudius was considered a rather unlikely man to become emperor. He was reportedly afflicted with some type of disability, and his family had virtually excluded him from public office until his  consulship with his nephew  Caligula in  37. This infirmity may have saved him from the fate of many other Roman nobles during the purges of  Tiberius' and Caligula's reigns. His very survival led to his being declared emperor after Caligula's assassination, at which point he was the last adult male of his family. Despite his lack of political experience, Claudius proved to be an able administrator and a great builder of public works. His reign saw an expansion of the empire, including the  conquest of Britain. He took a personal interest in the law, presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day. However, he was seen as vulnerable throughout his rule, particularly by the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position—resulting in the deaths of many  senators. He also suffered tragic setbacks in his personal life, one of which led to his murder. These events damaged his reputation among the ancient writers.

       " 'Clothing': 'Clothing is defined, in its broadest sense, as coverings for the torso and limbs as well as coverings for the hands ( gloves), feet ( socks,  shoes,  sandals,  boots) and head ( hats,  caps). Humans nearly universally wear clothing, which is also known as dress, garments, attire, or apparel. People wear clothing for functional as well as for social reasons. Clothing protects the vulnerable  nude  human body from the extremes of weather, other features of our environment, and for safety reasons. But every article of clothing also carries a cultural and social meaning.People also decorate their bodies with  makeup or  cosmetics,  perfume, and other  ornamentation; they also cut, dye, and arrange the hair of their heads,  faces, and bodies (see  hairstyle), and sometimes also mark their skin (by  tattoos,  scarifications, and  piercings). All these decorations contribute to the overall effect and message of clothing, but do not constitute clothing per se.Articles carried rather than worn (such as  purses,  canes, and  umbrellas) are normally counted as  fashion accessories rather than as clothing.  Jewelry and  eyeglasses are usually counted as accessories as well, even though in common speech these items are described as being worn rather than carried.',\n",
       " 'Cloud': 'A cloud is a visible mass of condensed  droplets or frozen crystals suspended in the  atmosphere above the surface of the Earth or another  planetary body. The branch of meteorology in which clouds are studied is  nephology.On Earth, the condensing substance is water vapor, which forms small droplets of water or ice crystals, typically 0.01 mm in diameter. When surrounded with billions of other droplets or crystals, they are visible as clouds. Dense deep clouds exhibit a high reflectance (70% to 95%) throughout the  visible range of wavelengths: they thus appear  white, at least from the top. Cloud droplets tend to  scatter light very efficiently, so that the intensity of the solar radiation decreases with depth into the cloud, hence the  grey or even sometimes dark appearance of the clouds at their  base. Thin clouds may appear to have acquired the colour of their environment or background, and clouds illuminated by non-white light, such as during  sunrise or  sunset, may be colored accordingly. In the near-infrared range, however, clouds would appear very dark because the water that constitutes the cloud droplets strongly absorbs solar radiation at these wavelengths.',\n",

Still earlier collections of laws include the codex of  Ur-Nammu, king of  Ur (ca. 2050 BC), the Codex of  Eshnunna (ca. 1930 BC) and the codex of  Lipit-Ishtar of  Isin (ca. 1870 BC).It shows rules and punishments if those rules are broken, the punishments could be as little as a fine or as big as sentencing to death. It focuses on  theft, agriculture (or shepherding),  property damage,  women\\'s rights,  marriage rights,  children\\'s rights, slave rights,  murder,  death, and  injury. The punishment varies depending on the class of offenders and victims. For a comprehensive summary, see  Babylonian law.The laws do not accept excuses or explanations for mistakes or fault: the Code was openly displayed for all to see, so no man could plead ignorance of the law as an excuse. Few people, however, could read in that era (literacy mainly being the domain of scribes).Hammurabi (1728 BC–1686 BC) felt he had to write the code to please his gods. Unlike many earlier and contemporary kings, he did not consider himself related to any god, although he did call himself \"the favorite of the gods.\" In the upper part of the  stela, Hammurabi is shown in front of the throne of the sun god  Shamash.The laws (numbered from 1 to 282, but numbers 13 and 66-99 are missing) are inscribed in  Old Babylonian on an eight foot tall stela of black  basalt . It was discovered in December 1901 in  Susa,  Elam, which is now  Khuzestan, Iran, where it had been taken as plunder by the Elamite king  Shutruk-Nahhunte in the 12th century BC. It is currently on display at the  Louvre Museum in Paris, France.The code is often pointed to as the first example of the legal concept that some laws are so basic as to be beyond the ability of even a  king to change. By writing the laws on stone they were immutable. This concept lives on in most modern legal systems and has given rise to the term written in stone.The Code of Hammurabi was one of many sets of laws in the  Ancient Near East. Most of these law codes, coming from similar cultures and racial groups in a relatively small geographical area, necessarily have passages that resemble each other. For example, the laws found in the later  Hittite code of laws (ca. 1300 BC) have some individual laws that bear a passing resemblance to those in the Code of Hammurabi, as well as other codices from the same geographic area. The earlier Ur-Nammu, of the written literature prolific  Ur-III dynasty (21st century BC), also produced a code of laws, some of which bear resemblance to certain specific laws in the Code of Hammurabi. The later  Mosaic Law (according to the modern  documentary hypothesis ca. 700-500 BC - under  Hezekiah/ Josiah; traditionally ca. 1200 BC - under  Moses) also has some laws that resemble the Code of Hammurabi, as well as other law codes of the region.',\n",

The main U.S. allies were Western Europe and Japan. The main Soviet allies were Eastern Europe and (until the  Sino-Soviet Split), China. Throughout the period, the rivalry was played out in multiple arenas: military coalitions, ideology; a massive conventional and  nuclear arms race; and proxy wars.In 1947 the term \"Cold War\" was introduced by Americans  Bernard Baruch and  Walter Lippmann to describe emerging tensions between the two former wartime allies. There never was a major battle between the U.S. and the Soviets. But there was a half-century of military buildups, and political battles for support around the world. There also were proxy wars, such as the  Korean War and the Vietnam War.Although the U.S. and the Soviet Union had been wartime allies against Nazi Germany, even before the end of the Second World War, the two sides differed on how to reconstruct the postwar world. Over the following decades, the Cold War spread outside Europe to every region of the world, as the U.S. sought \" containment\" of communism and forged alliances, particularly in Western Europe, the Mideast, and Southeast Asia.There were repeated crises that threatened to escalate into world wars (but never did), notably the  Korean War (1950-1953), the  Cuban Missile Crisis (1962), and the Vietnam War (1964-1975), but there were also periods when tension was reduced as both sides sought  détente.

Hermann Göring — holder of the singular rank  Reichsmarschall (\" Field Marshal of the Empire\") — even declared Colditz \"escape-proof\". This was in part because of its lack of escapes during its term as prison camp in World War I, but mostly due to it being the only German  prisoner-of-war camp with more guards than prisoners.

       " 'Color': 'Colour (or colour, see  spelling differences) is the  visual perceptual property corresponding in humans to the categories called red, yellow, white, etc. Colour derives from the  spectrum of light (distribution of light energy versus wavelength) interacting in the eye with the spectral sensitivities of the light receptors. Color categories and physical specifications of colour are also associated with objects, materials, light sources, etc., based on their physical properties such as light absorption, reflection, or emission spectra.Typically, only features of the composition of light that are detectable by humans (wavelength spectrum from 400 nm to 700 nm, roughly) are included, thereby objectively relating the psychological phenomenon of color to its physical specification. Since perception of colour stems from the varying sensitivity of different types of  cone cells in the retina to different parts of the spectrum, colors may be defined and quantified by the degree to which they stimulate these cells. These physical or physiological quantifications of color, however, do not fully explain the psychophysical perception of colour appearance.The science of colour is sometimes called chromatics. It includes the perception of color by the human eye and brain, the origin of colour in materials,  colour theory in art, and the physics of electromagnetic radiation in the visible range (that is, what we commonly refer to simply as light).',\n",

Shoemaker-Levy 9 was located on the night of  March 24,  1993, in a photograph taken with the 0.4- metre  Schmidt telescope at the  Mount Palomar Observatory in California. Unlike all other comets discovered before then, it was orbiting Jupiter rather than the Sun.SL9 was in pieces ranging in size up to 2\\xa0 kilometres in diameter, and is believed to have been pulled apart by Jupiter\\'s  tidal forces during a close encounter in July 1992. These fragments collided with Jupiter\\'s southern hemisphere over a period of time between  July 16 and  July 22,  1994, at a speed of approximately 60\\xa0 kilometres per second (37\\xa0 miles per second). The prominent scars from the impacts could be seen on Jupiter for many months after the impact, and observers described them as more easily visible than the Great Red Spot.',\n",
       " 'Comet_White-Ortiz-Bolelli': 'Comet White-Ortiz-Bolelli (formal designation: C/1970 K1) was a bright comet which appeared in  1970. It was a member of the  Kreutz Sungrazers, a family of comets which resulted from the break-up of a large parent comet several centuries ago. It was already easily visible to the  naked eye when first discovered, and reached a maximum  apparent magnitude of 1.',\n",
       " 'Comics': \"Comics (or, less commonly, sequential art) is a form of  visual art consisting of images which are commonly combined with text, often in the form of  speech balloons or image captions. Originally used to illustrate  caricatures and to entertain through the use of amusing and trivial stories, it has by now evolved into a literary medium with many subgenres.The most common forms of printed comics are  comic strips (most commonly four  panels long) in newspapers and  magazines, and longer comic stories in  comic books,  graphic novels and comic albums. In the first two forms the comics are secondary material usually confined to the entertainment sections, while the latter consist either entirely or primarily of comics.Depending on the definition of the term, the origin of comics can be traced back to 15th century Europe. However, today's form of comics (with panels, and using text within the image in speech balloons, etc.), as well as the term comics itself, originated in the late 19th century.\",\n",
       " 'Comma_Johanneum': 'The Comma Johanneum is a  comma, or short clause, present in most translations of the  First Epistle of John published from  1522 until the latter part of the nineteenth century, owing to the widespread use of the third edition of the  Textus Receptus (TR) as the sole source for translation. In readings containing the clause, such as this one from the  King James Bible, 1 John 5:7–8 reads as follows, the Comma itself here rendered with emphasis:',\n",
       " 'Commodore_64': 'The Commodore 64 is the best selling single  personal computer model of all time. Released in August 1982, the Commodore 64 is commonly referred to as the C64 (sometimes written C= 64 to mimic the Commodore company logo) and occasionally known as CBM64 (its model designation), C-64 or VIC-64 (a label used by some users, magazine writers, third party advertisements and also by Commodore in Sweden  ). The Commodore 64 casing has affectionately been nicknamed the \"breadbox\" and \"bullnose\" due to its shape. Introduced by  Commodore Business Machines in August 1982 at a price of US$595, it offered 64\\xa0 kilobytes of  RAM with sound and graphics performance that compared favourably with IBM-compatible computers of that time. During the Commodore 64\\'s lifetime (between 1982 and 1994), sales totaled around 17 million units.Unlike computers that were distributed only through authorized dealers, Commodore also targeted  department stores and toy stores. The unit could be plugged directly into a television set to play games, giving it much of the appeal of dedicated  video game consoles like the  Atari 2600. Its affordable pricing contributed to the  video game market crash of 1983.Approximately 10,000 commercial  software titles were made for the Commodore 64 including development tools, office applications, and games. The machine is also credited with popularizing the computer  demo scene. The Commodore 64 is still used today by many computer hobbyists, and  emulators allow anyone with a modern computer (or even smartphones such as the  sx1) to run these programs on their desktop (with varying degrees of success and functionality).The Commodore 64 is commonly seen as an icon of the  1980s. An example is the introductory movie of the video game  Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, which features a Commodore 64 screen which later reveals the  Rockstar North logo.',\n",
       " 'Common_Basilisk': 'Basiliscus basiliscus or basilisk is a  lizard found in  Central and South American rainforests near rivers and streams. It is up to 75 cm (2.5 feet) long including the tail and eats insects, small invertebrates, flowers, and small vertebrates like  snakes, birds, and fish.Its predators include large birds of prey, snakes, fish, other large reptiles, and mammals. This animal is not endangered.It is part of the  iguana family. It, along with the  Brown basilisk, has the nickname \"Jesus Christ Lizard\" or \"Jesus Lizard\" because when fleeing from a predator, it is very fast and can even run on top of water for a brief while.Basilisks have large hind feet with flaps of skin between each toe. These are rolled up when the animal walks on land. If the animal faces danger, it starts to run very fast on the surface of a river or a lake. Then the flaps on its hind feet are opened and thus more surface area is provided for it to run on water.Smaller basilisks can run about 10-20 m on the water surface without sinking, and can usually run farther than older ones. Like most reptiles, basilisks are active during the day. They have long toes and sharp claws. Most are under 25 cm (1 foot) in length, but some may grow up 75 cm. Basilisks usually weigh between 200-600 grams.Their maximum lifespan is probably around 7-8 years, but in the wild, most die much sooner. Females lay about 2-18 eggs, five to eight times a year. Eggs hatch after about three months and the young weigh about 2 grams. Their outstanding camouflage allows them to remain motionless and very hard to detect.

       " 'Common_Cuckoo': 'The Common Cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) is a member of the  cuckoo order of birds, the Cuculiformes, which also includes the  roadrunners, the  anis, the  coucals, and the  Hoatzin.The cuckoo group gets its English and scientific names from the call of the male Common Cuckoo, usually given from an open perch, goo-ko. The female has a loud bubbling call.The cuckoo is a widespead summer migrant to Europe and western Asia, and winters in Africa. It is a  brood parasite, which lays its eggs in the nests of other bird species, particularly of Dunnocks,  Meadow Pipits, and Reed Warblers.This cuckoo is a greyish bird with a slender body, long tail and strong legs. The females only are sometimes brown, the “hepatic” phase. It looks like a small bird of prey in flight, although the wings stay below the horizontal. Its food is insects, with hairy  caterpillars, which are distasteful to many birds, being a speciality. It is a bird of open land.',\n",

       " 'Common_Eland': 'The Common Eland, or Southern Eland, (Taurotragus oryx) is a  savannah and  plain antelope found in East and Southern Africa.The Common Eland stands around two metres at the shoulder and weighs 275  kilograms (600  lb) to a  tonne (2,200 lb). Females are sometimes less than half the weight of adult males. This species and the so-called Giant Eland, which are actually about the same size as the Common, are the largest of world\\'s \"antelopes\". Common Eland females have a tan coat while the males\\' coat is a darker tan with a blue tinge to it, there may be a single white stripe vertically placed on the sides. The males have dense fur on their foreheads and a large  dewlap. Both sexes have horns, which are about 65  centimetres (26  in) long and almost straight. The horns of the female are longer but thinner than those of the male.Common Eland live on the savannah and eat  grass,  branches and  leaves. They are  diurnal but tend towards inactivity during the heat of the day. Herds are usually between thirty and eighty individuals but are known to reach upwards of four hundred. The Common Eland has an unusual social life. They come and go, taking advantage of herd life when they need to without forming close ties.They \"are very agile and can easily jump a 1.5 m fence from a standing start\" (sign from Western Plains Zoo, Dubbo, NSW, Australia).Common Eland are sometimes considered part of the  genus  Tragelaphus but it is usually categorised as  Taurotragus with the Giant Eland.

       " 'Common_Hazel': \"The Common Hazel (Corylus avellana) is a species of  hazel native to Europe and Asia. It is typically a  shrub reaching 3-8 m tall, but can reach 15 m on occasion. The  leaves are  deciduous, rounded, 6-12 cm long and across, softly hairy on both surfaces, and with a double-serrate margin.The flowers are produced very early in spring before the leaves and are  monoecious, with single-sex  catkins, the male pale yellow and 5-12 cm long, the female very small and largely concealed in the  buds, with only the bright red 1-3 mm long  styles visible. The fruit is a  nut, produced in clusters of one to five together, each nut held in a short leafy  involucre ('husk') which encloses about three quarters of the nut. The nut is roughly  spherical to oval, 15-25 mm long and 12-20 mm broad, yellow-brown with a pale  scar at the base. The nut falls out of the  involucre when ripe, about 7-8 months after  pollination. It is readily distinguished from the closely related  Filbert (Corylus maxima) by the short involucre; in the Filbert the nut is fully enclosed by a beak-like involucre longer than the nut.Common Hazel is used by a number of species of  Lepidoptera as a food plant.The name of the  species, avellana is derived from Avellino, a place in Italy.

       " 'Common_Pheasant': 'The Common Pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) is a  gamebird in the  pheasant family Phasianidae of the order Galliformes, gallinaceous birds.The adult pheasant is 50-90 cm in length with a long tail, often accounting for half the total length. The male (cock or rooster) has barred bright brown plumage and green, purple and white markings, often including a white ring around the neck, and the head is green with distinctive red patches. This bird is also called the Common or English Pheasant, or just Pheasant. The males are  polygynous and are often accompanied by a harem of several females.The nominate race P. c. colchicus lacks a white neck ring. This is however shown by the race Ring-necked Pheasant, P. c. torquatus which after several failed attempts was successfully introduced to the United States in 1881.The female (hen) is much less showy, with a duller mottled brown plumage all over, similar to that of the  partridge. The birds are found on wooded land and scrub. They feed on the ground on grain, leaves and invertebrates, but roost in trees at night. They nest on the ground, producing a clutch of around ten  eggs over a two-three week period in April to June. The incubation period is about 23-26 days. The chicks stay near the hen for several weeks after hatching but grow quickly, resembling adults by only 15 weeks of age.While pheasants are able short-distance fliers, they prefer to run: but if startled they can suddenly burst upwards at great speed, with a distinctive \"whirring\" wing sound. Their flight speed is only 27 to 38 mph when cruising but when chased they can fly up to 60 mph.They are native to Asia but have been widely introduced elsewhere, where they are bred to be hunted and are shot in great numbers. The doggerel \"up flies a guinea, bang goes sixpence and down comes half-a-crown\" reflects that they are often shot for sport rather than as food. If eaten the meat is somewhat tough and dry, so the carcasses were often hung for a time to improve the meat by slight decomposition, as with most other game. Modern cookery generally uses moist roasting or farm-raised female birds.Pheasant farming is a common practice, and is sometimes done  intensively. Birds are supplied both to  hunting preserves/estates and restaurants, with smaller numbers being available for home cooks. Pheasant farms have some 10 million birds in the U.S. and 35 million in the United Kingdom. The Common Pheasant is also one of the prime target of small game  poachers. The  Roald Dahl novel \" Danny the Champion of the World\" dealt with a poacher (and his son) who lived in the United Kingdom and illegally hunted common pheasants.The bird was brought to  Britain around the 10th century but became extinct in the early 17th century; it was reintroduced in the 1830s and is now widespread. Repeated reintroduction has made the pheasant a very variable species in regard to size and plumage. Pheasants were introduced in North America in 1913, being released at Dog Ear Butte. They are most common in the  Great Plains, where they are often seen in hay, grass wheat, and CRP fields. A preferred nesting site for them is along fence rows, wheat, and under old machinery.The term pheasant can also be used for other gallinaceous birds such as the  quail or  partridge, and in North America it is occasionally used to refer to the ruffed  grouse.The  Green Pheasant of Japan is very similar to Common Pheasant, but the males have greenish plumage. The Ring-Necked Pheasant is the  state bird of  South Dakota, one of only three US state birds that is not a species native to the United States.',\n",
       " 'Common_Tern': 'The Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) is a  seabird of the tern family Sternidae. This bird has a circumpolar distribution breeding in temperate and sub-arctic regions of Europe, Asia and east and central North America. It is strongly migratory, wintering in the subtropical and tropical oceans. It is sometimes known as the sea swallow.This is a medium-sized tern, 34-37 cm long with a 70-80 cm wingspan. It is most readily confused within its range with the similar Arctic Tern Sterna paradisaea and  Roseate Tern Sterna dougalli.Its thin sharp bill is red with a dark tip. Its longish legs are also red. Its upperwings show a dark primary wedge, unlike Arctic, in which they are uniformly grey. Its long tail extends only to the wingtips on the standing bird, unlike Arctic and Roseate Terns, which extend past the wingtips. It is not as pale as Roseate Tern, and has longer wings.In winter, the forehead and underparts are white. Juvenile Common Terns show extensive ginger coloration and lack the scaly appearance of juvenile Roseate Terns.The call is a clear piping, like Arctic Tern but lower pitched and less strident.This species breeds in colonies on coasts and islands and often inland on suitable freshwater lakes. This latter practice is assisted by the provision of floating \"tern rafts\" to give a safe breeding area. It lays two to four eggs. Like many white terns, it is very defensive of its nest and young and will attack humans and other large predators, but unlike the more aggressive Arctic Tern rarely hits the intruder, usually swerving off at the last moment.Like all Sterna terns, the Common Tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, from either the sea or freshwater lakes and large rivers. It usually dives directly, and not from the \"stepped-hover\" favoured by Arctic Tern. The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display. Common terns are known to reach an age of 23 years or more on occasion (Austin, 1953).The old Scottish word for the Common Tern is pictar, occasionally encountered in Scotland and the  Maritime Provinces of Canada.The Common Tern is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds ( AEWA) applies.',\n",

       " 'Common_cold': 'Acute viral nasopharyngitis, often known as the common cold, is a mild  viral  infectious disease of the upper  respiratory system ( nose and  throat). Symptoms include  sneezing, sniffling, runny nose,  nasal congestion; scratchy, sore, or  phlegmy throat;  coughing;  headache; and tiredness. Colds typically last three to five days, with residual coughing lasting up to three weeks. It is the most common of all human  diseases, infecting adults at an average rate of 2-4 infections per year, and school aged children as many as 12 times per year. Infection rates greater than three infections per year per person are not uncommon in some populations. Children and their parents or caretakers are at a higher risk, possibly due to the high population density of schools and the fact that transmission to family members is highly efficient.The common cold belongs to the  upper respiratory tract infections. It is different from  influenza, a more severe viral infection of the respiratory tract that shows the additional symptoms of rapidly rising  fever,  chills, and body and  muscle aches. While the common cold itself is rarely life threatening, its complications, such as pneumonia, can very well be.',\n",

Attendance at the Commonwealth Games is typically around 5,000 athletes.The first such event, then known as the British Empire Games, was held in 1930 in  Hamilton, Ontario Canada. The name changed to British Empire and Commonwealth Games in 1954, to British Commonwealth Games in 1970 and assumed the current name of the Commonwealth Games in 1974.As well as many  Olympic sports, the Games also include some sports that are played mainly in Commonwealth countries, such as  lawn bowls,  rugby sevens and netball.There are currently 53 members of the Commonwealth of Nations, and 71 teams participate in the Games. The four  constituent countries of the United Kingdom—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland—send separate teams to the Commonwealth Games, and individual teams are also sent from the British  Crown Dependencies—Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man—and many of the  British overseas territories. The Australian external territory of Norfolk Island also sends its own team, as do the Cook Islands and Niue, two non-sovereign states in free association with New Zealand.Only six teams have attended every Commonwealth Games: Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, Scotland and Wales.',\n",
       " 'Communication': 'Communication is not only the process of sharing information. Communication processes are in most cases sign-mediated interactions which are governed by three levels of semiotic rules, syntactic, pragmatic and semantic. Therefore communication is a kind of social interaction where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of semiotic rules. In a simplistic form information is sent from a sender or encoder to a receiver or decoder. In a more complex form feedback links a sender to a receiver. This requires a symbolic activity, sometimes via a language. Communication development is the development of processes enabling one to understand what others say (or sign or write) and speak (or sign or write, translate sounds and symbols into meaning, and learn the syntax of the language. Communication is based on the idea of respect, promises, and the want for social improvement. Specialised fields focus on various aspects of communication, and include the following:',\n",
