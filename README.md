# What can wikispeedia teach us about making decisions in life?

## Abstract

TODO: Expliciter que c'est un bold statement comme elle avait dit

Our project explores principles for thoughtful choices, using insights from the Wikispeedia dataset. First, it's crucial not to rely solely on large language models (LLMs) for guidance, as they provide data on topics but not necessarily the best course of action. Consulting others (leveraging crowd knowledge) can also enrich decision-making, though it’s important to understand that crowds don’t always succeed; examining specific paths reveals how groupthink and misjudgments can lead to failure. Recognizing that everything is interconnected—similar to the "small world" phenomenon—highlights that even seemingly minor information can be significant. Analyzing failed attempts to reach a target page in Wikispeedia, we find that some users may not have examined the full content of each page or made a thorough effort. This may reflect a tendency to stick to surface-level information, suggesting that better decisions often come from fully exploring available information rather than stopping at the first glance.

## Research questions
 - Does people lazyness affect their performance ? Is there a noticeable difference in the page position of clicked links between successful and unsuccessful players? Do people click more on subjects they already know more about?
 - Will a crowd of players do better than the same players indicidually ? In other words, does Condorcet's jury theorem apply ?
